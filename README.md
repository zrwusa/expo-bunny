## Development

### local web server
```sh
yarn build:web
yarn web:server
```
### For responsive development

Just configure the dimensions size used by the designer, responsiveFromUE will automatically be compatible different devices

src/config.json

  "UE": {
    "dimensions": {
      "DesignName": {
        "width": 360,
        "height": 640
      }
      ...
    }
  }

in your pages or styles

```javascript
    const {ms, responsive} = useSizer();
    const {wp} = responsive.iphoneX;
```

ms: measure util defined sizes for styles(recommend use this to keep consistency)

wp: width to DP based on your designs

hp: height to DP based on your designs

You can define multiple design configurations, because your designs are often not designed by the same designer

### For explicit navigation tree

NavigationTree: Explicitly define a navigation tree, and the navigation of the entire App is clear at a glance. 

Navigator components are automatically generated through configuration, 

and the nesting relationship between Navigators is automatically generated. 

There is no need to define Navigator components separately, 

just care about Screens components.

At the same time,linking configuration is automatically generated. 

No modification of React Navigation, you can use any configuration of React Navigation with confidence.
