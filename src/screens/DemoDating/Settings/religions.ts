Currently, she is analyzing the archaeological remains of several early Christian sites in the eastern Mediterranean to elucidate patterns of ritualized movement in late antiquity. Camille is a field archaeologist and has excavated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. In 2018, she and Joshua Silver launched the Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP), a digital humanities collective dedicated to creating three-dimensional reconstructions of late antique ritual spaces. The same year, Camille received a grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation and was appointed to the Society of Biblical Literatureâs Graduate Student Advisory Board. She is also an Associate Editor of the MAVCOR Journal published by the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion.",

Currently, she is analyzing the archaeological remains of several early Christian sites in the eastern Mediterranean to elucidate patterns of ritualized movement in late antiquity. Camille is a field archaeologist and has excavated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. In 2018, she and Joshua Silver launched the Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP), a digital humanities collective dedicated to creating three-dimensional reconstructions of late antique ritual spaces. The same year, Camille received a grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation and was appointed to the Society of Biblical Literatureâs Graduate Student Advisory Board. She is also an Associate Editor of the MAVCOR Journal published by the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion.",

Currently, she is analyzing the archaeological remains of several early Christian sites in the eastern Mediterranean to elucidate patterns of ritualized movement in late antiquity. Camille is a field archaeologist and has excavated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. In 2018, she and Joshua Silver launched the Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP), a digital humanities collective dedicated to creating three-dimensional reconstructions of late antique ritual spaces. The same year, Camille received a grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation and was appointed to the Society of Biblical Literatureâs Graduate Student Advisory Board. She is also an Associate Editor of the MAVCOR Journal published by the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion.",

Currently, she is analyzing the archaeological remains of several early Christian sites in the eastern Mediterranean to elucidate patterns of ritualized movement in late antiquity. Camille is a field archaeologist and has excavated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. In 2018, she and Joshua Silver launched the Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP), a digital humanities collective dedicated to creating three-dimensional reconstructions of late antique ritual spaces. The same year, Camille received a grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation and was appointed to the Society of Biblical Literatureâs Graduate Student Advisory Board. She is also an Associate Editor of the MAVCOR Journal published by the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion.",

Currently, she is analyzing the archaeological remains of several early Christian sites in the eastern Mediterranean to elucidate patterns of ritualized movement in late antiquity. Camille is a field archaeologist and has excavated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. In 2018, she and Joshua Silver launched the Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP), a digital humanities collective dedicated to creating three-dimensional reconstructions of late antique ritual spaces. The same year, Camille received a grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation and was appointed to the Society of Biblical Literatureâs Graduate Student Advisory Board. She is also an Associate Editor of the MAVCOR Journal published by the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion.",

Currently, she is analyzing the archaeological remains of several early Christian sites in the eastern Mediterranean to elucidate patterns of ritualized movement in late antiquity. Camille is a field archaeologist and has excavated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. In 2018, she and Joshua Silver launched the Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP), a digital humanities collective dedicated to creating three-dimensional reconstructions of late antique ritual spaces. The same year, Camille received a grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation and was appointed to the Society of Biblical Literatureâs Graduate Student Advisory Board. She is also an Associate Editor of the MAVCOR Journal published by the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion.",

He subsequently spent ten years living in and around Tibetan refugee communities in India and Nepal, studying Tibetan language, Buddhist philosophy, and meditative practices. In 2015, he began studying in Rice Universityâs Department of Religion with Dr. Anne C. Klein, professor of Religious Studies. His general interests include meditative and philosophical systems in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, phenomenology, and contemplative studies. His research focuses on the psychophysical transformation that occurs within religious practice, and the associated epistemologies that are both utilized while approaching this goal and born from such transformation. He has taught courses at Rice entitled Introduction to Buddhism, Buddhist Art and Literature, and Tibetan Language, Literature, and Culture. He served for two years as the Chair of the Department of Religionâs mentorship program. He is currently writing his dissertation, which focuses on the theme of purification in the writings and practices of fourteenth-century Tibetan thinkers Longchen Rabjam and the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje.",

Currently, she is analyzing the archaeological remains of several early Christian sites in the eastern Mediterranean to elucidate patterns of ritualized movement in late antiquity. Camille is a field archaeologist and has excavated in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. In 2018, she and Joshua Silver launched the Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP), a digital humanities collective dedicated to creating three-dimensional reconstructions of late antique ritual spaces. The same year, Camille received a grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation and was appointed to the Society of Biblical Literatureâs Graduate Student Advisory Board. She is also an Associate Editor of the MAVCOR Journal published by the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion.",

                "biography": "I am a specialist in Roman provincial economic history and epigraphy whose work takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding local economies through the lens of indigenous religion in the Roman west. I employ Latin votive dedications set up to Aquitanian, Gallic, and Hispano-Celtic deities with industrially suggestive names in the Roman Pyrenees, southern Gaul , and Central Spain to gauge whether new industries altered the roles of indigenous deities to meet expanded demands of the Roman economy for iron, marble, pork, and honey. My research shows the potential that Latin votive dedications erected within extractive communities hold for understanding the integration of indigenous populations in the Roman west into large-scale industries like mining and quarrying. My research also tracks the effect of such large-scale industries on traditional economic activities like beekeeping and silvopastoralism.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, I became an investigator on the Hesperia Project, a digital databank of Paleohispanic languages, as it advances into Gallia Lugudunensis. The project is coordinated by professors JoaquÃ­n Gorrochategui and JosÃ© MarÃ­a Vallejo of the Universidad del PaÃ­s Vasco.\r\nhttp://hesperia.ucm.es/index.php\r\n\r\nMy recent work focuses on the archaeology and history of beekeeping in the post-Roman Iberian Peninsula. At SDSU, I am undertaking an investigation of bee forage plants mentioned in Late Antique and medieval textual sources from the Visigothic Kingdom and al-Andalus. This work will provide a vehicle for applying historical data concerning bee forage plants to the current environment, healing the future with the past by recreating more stable ecosystems for bees through tailored replanting of historical bee forage plants. A long-term goal of this work is to create a global historical bee-forage database to allow individuals and communities to keep bees more sustainably based on models from the past.",

    "description": "Historically, the Natchez occupied the area around what is now the Old St. Catherineâs Creek and the city of Natchez, Mississippi. The Natchez have had contact with Christian Europeans beginning with Spanish conquistadors as early as the sixteenth century, followed by the arrival of the French in the late seventeenth century (Lorenz, 2020). This entry focuses on the Natchez around the time of 1718, before significant cultural change and the end of autonomous authority. Natchez religious beliefs center around a supreme high god or spirit known as Coyocop-chill who is described as a creator deity and is associated with the Sun. Other spirits and supernatural beings are present and ultimately ruled by Coyocop-chil. Natchez beliefs state that a man and woman, as earthly manifestations of the supreme high god, came to the Natchez and brought with them fire from the sun as well as customs and rules of governance and descent (Lorenz, 2020). The descendants of these godly individuals comprise the royal class, and the hereditary position of paramount chief is passed through this lineage. The paramount chief, or Great Sun, is both the political and religious leader. The supreme spirit is said to reside in the Great Sun. A temple contains the sacred fire brought from the sun; the Great Sun and temple guardians are tasked with ensuring the fire burns eternally. Because religion is bound with the functioning of Natchez society at large, this entry considers the religion to be coterminous with Natchez society.",

    "description": "This entry focuses on the people living in what is now the Punjab Province of Pakistan. Specifically, this entry focuses on the rural Punjabi village of Mohla, located in Gujrat District, between the time of 1947-1958. This time frame begins with the establishment of Pakistan in 1947 and ends prior to the substantial government changes of 1948. The principal ethnographic source for this society, Zekiye Suleyman Eglar (1960), selected Mohla because it was not greatly affected by the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, allowing for the study of traditional Punjabi culture. Most Punjabis are Muslim and follow Islam. However, religious beliefs and practices are not discussed in depth by the principal authority. Consequently, the present entry provides a general overview and is limited to the information that is available. Religious activities follow the Muslim calendar, which is tied to the cycle of the moon. Religious leaders include the village imam, whose role involves formalized rituals, and the pirs or spiritual leaders. Eglar (1960:71) states that âpeople know the fundamentals of their religion, which are so interwoven with their lives that they are a way of life to them.â The present entry considers the Punjabi religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",

    "description": "Jebel Barkal is an isolated sandstone butte beside the Nile, 23 km downstream from the mouth of the 4th cataract, near Karima, Sudan (N 18Â° 32.081, E 31Â° 49.876).  In ancient times it was called variously âPure Mountainâ and âThrone of the Two Landsâ and was the chief landmark of a city called Napata, which marked the southern limit of Egyptâs African empire during the New Kingdom.  Perhaps even from prehistoric times, this hill was believed by the ancient Nubians to be the residence of a supreme Creator god and progenitor of kingship.  When the Egyptians conquered this region (known as âKushâ) about 1500 BC, they identified the god of the mountain as a primeval form of their own state god Amun of Karnak, whose chief sanctuary at Thebes lay 1260 km downstream.  \n\nFor centuries, the Egyptians had considered their king to be the son of Amun, and the Nile inundation to be his gift to Egypt. Since the Nile flood emanated from the distant South, they thus imagined that somewhere deep inside Kush, at or near the mysterious Nile sources, Amun had a primordial alter-ego, who released the waters each year, just as he had at the beginning of time.  It was this same primeval Amun whom they also believed dispensed the âroyal ka,â the divine essence of kingship granted by the god to each new king, believed to be his own son.  When the Egyptians occupied Kush, they accepted Jebel Barkal as the place where this god dwelt.\n\nIf one gazes upon the hill today, it is easy to see why it acquired such revered status. Standing all alone in a vast desert plain, it was the perfect archetype of the legendary âPrimeval Mound,â on which Creation was thought to have taken place. It faces the Nile with a sheer cliff, and from one corner rises a towering pinnacle, 75 m high, which, to ancient eyes, looked like a gigantic statue â but one in which different forms appeared, depending on the angle from which it was seen:  a) a colossal standing king, wearing the crown of Upper Egypt, b) an erect phallus, suggestive of Amunâs first creative act, and c) a rearing cobra (âuraeusâ), suggesting both the presence of a mother goddess in serpent form and the symbol of kingship itself. By projecting all these forms, the pinnacle personified the primeval Amun himself (âKamutefâ), who was both male and female, embodied his own father and mother, and was able to generate and regenerate himself as his own child: the first divine king from whose body all others were thought to descend. \n\nAlthough Jebel Barkal was infrequently visited by the pharaohs, its sanctuary became the largest in Nubia.  As a coronation complex, it was thought to be a place where the king entered the mountain and ritually merged with the body of the god, his âfather,â absorbing the âroyal kaâ and thus becoming a god-king himself.  \n\nWith the decline of the New Kingdom, the pharaohs were forced to retreat from Kush, which effectively cut their link to Jebel Barkal and their âfather,â the primeval Amun, and severed their access to the âroyal ka.â  As Egypt's kings weakened in this way, a native Nubian dynasty emerged at Napata, claiming to be Amunâs new âsons,â the exclusive possessors of the âroyal ka,â and thus the only legitimate kings of Egypt.  By about 720 BCE these southern kings, in league with the Egyptian Amun priesthood at Thebes, seized control of Egypt and their family became the countryâs 25th Dynasty.  \n\nAfter sixty years, the kings of Kush were expelled from Egypt by the invading Assyrians, but they returned to their homeland and established a kingdom in Sudan centered at Meroe that lasted another millennium.  Throughout most of that time Jebel Barkal remained the site of the chief cult center of their kingdom, where generations of their kings received their crowns from the god in the mountain and nearby which many built their pyramids.",

    "description": "The so-called Serapeum of Thessalonica was not dedicated only to Serapis, nor has this name survived through the ancient sources; the name Serapeum was given by the researchers who excavated the site in the early 20th century and has survived ever since. it consists of at least four buildings: a small temple with a rectangular plan, another small temple in antis or prostyle with a crypt, and some other auxiliary spaces. The large number of statues and inscriptions suggests that the sanctuary hosted the cult of the Isiac family but also other deities such as Aphrodite, Athena, Pan. All these artifacts are a result of many chronological phases. During its five centuries of use, buildings were constructed, and probably buildings were reused for a different purpose. The different forms of deities worshiped in the sanctuary bear evidence of a vivid cult that involved numerous people: locals, Egyptians, Roman negotiatores, etc. They also reflect a strong network of religious connectivity between Thessalonica and other sites in the Aegean such as Delos, but also between Thessalonica and inland sites, such as Stobi.",

    "description": "A dualistic, Neo-Manichean sect founded in Bulgaria in the 10th c. Heavily influenced by the Paulicans, Bogomilism denied many of the basic tenets of Orthodox Christianity, including the Incarnation, the earthly miracles of Jesus, and the Old Testament in its entirety. Holding that the material world and all things of matter were the creation of Satan, the Bogomils were often at odds with ecclesiastical authorities in the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires and preached a creed of active civil disobedience. Most of our information about them comes from polemics written against them, including those by Kosmas the Priest, Anna Komnene, Germanos II, and Euthymios Zigabenos. Only one piece of Bogomil apocrypha survives, the Interrogatio Johannis, or the Liber Secretus. Originally founded by an unknown priest in the mid-10th c. who took the name âBogomil,â which, according to Kosmas means âbeloved of Godâ in old Slavonic, by the 12th c. the sect could claim followers throughout the Balkans, Asia Minor, and in Constantinople itself, including amongst the elite. A core of ascetic practitioners adhered to an abstinence from meat, sexual intercourse, and wine. Actively persecuted throughout their existence, they nonetheless found many converts, particularly in the Balkans. In the early 13th c. they had become the dominant religious group in Bosnia, where they became known as the Patarenes, prompting crusading action against them. They subsequently entered Northern Italy and went on to influence the Cathars/Albigenses and the Waldensians. In Constantinople and Bulgaria their decline began in the 13th c. but they were not finally eradicated until Ottoman control over the Balkans was solidified in the 15th c.",

    "description": "The Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school belongs to the KagyÃ¼ school of Tibetan Buddhism. Standard Tibetan religious historiographies divide the KagyÃ¼ school into four main lineages: (1) the Phagdru KagyÃ¼ school with eight minor lineages founded by students of Phagmodrupa Dorje Gyelpo (1110â70), (2) the Karma KagyÃ¼ school, (3) the Barom KagyÃ¼ school, and (4) the Tshelpa KagyÃ¼ school. The Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school is counted among the minor lineages of (1) the Phagdru KagyÃ¼ school. However, the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school is also heterogeneous with different sub-branches, such as the Bhutanese branch (lho âbrug) with which this entry deals. \nIn detail, the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school goes back to the Buddhist master Tsangpa GyarÃ© Yeshe Dorje (1161â1211). In its beginnings, this school was associated with a strong emphasis on meditation and the simple lifestyle of mendicants. The Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school further split into three sub-branches, each established by another disciple of Tsangpa GyarÃ© Yeshe Dorje: (1) the middle Drukpa, (2) the upper Drukpa, and (3) the lower Drukpa. In fact, in reality, interactions between the sub-branches of the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ schools have been much more complex. \nBefore the seventeenth century, Buddhist masters of all three sub-branches of the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school were active and established religious institutions in Bhutan, such as Phajo Drukgom Zhikpo (1184â1251) or the famous âMadman of the Drukpa,â Drukpa KÃ¼nlÃ© (1455â1529). The Bhutanese branch of the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school (Tib. lho âbrug) was newly established after the seventeenth century resulting from an additional split of the middle Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school into a âNorthern,â i. e. Tibetan/Ladakhi, and âSouthern,â i. e. Bhutanese branch. This split was caused by a dispute over Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594âca. 1651) as the rightful incarnation of the earlier eminent lineage master, the 4th Drukchen KÃ¼nkhyen Pema Karpo (1527-92). This subsequently led to Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyelâs flight to Bhutan and the foundation of the State of Bhutan in 1625/26.\n\nIn Bhutan, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel successfully institutionalized a system of governance that united religious and political authority, the âJoint Twofold System of Governanceâ (Tib. srid chos gnyis ldan). Under him, a regent exercised political power while the âChief Abbot of Bhutanâ oversaw the religious institutions and was the head of the new Bhutanese Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school-starting with the 1st Chief Abbot Pekar JungnÃ© (1604â72). This âJoint Twofold System of Governanceâ was renewed in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan from 2008. As of today, the 70th Chief Abbot Tulku JigmÃ© ChÃ¶dra (b. 1955) is in office. In particular, regarding the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school as a religious group, the relationship between the societal spheres of religion and politics is complex and very interesting. \nAs in the other KagyÃ¼ schools, the central doctrine and meditative system in the Bhutanese Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school is MahÄmudrÄ (Tib. phyag rgya chen po). Other essential teachings are the âSix Yogas of NÄropa,â called in this school the teachings of âMerging and Transferenceâ (Tib. bsre âpho), and the âSix Cycles of Equal Tasteâ (Tib. ro snyoms skor drug). In particular, since the seventeenth century, important doctrinal and ritualistic innovations and new teaching cycles by their founder Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel were introduced. This entry covers the Bhutanese Drukpa KagyuÌ school (Tib. lho âbrug), but it does not include religious groups of the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ schools outside of Bhutan on a global scale, primarily associated with branches and monasteries of the Drukpa KagyÃ¼ school from Ladakh, Darjeeling, or Tibet. \n\nTechnical note: Tibetan and Bhutanese proper names, place names, and terms are spelled phonetically roughly according to the THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription of Standard Tibetan by David Germano and Nicolas Tournadre.

    "description": "Zhou Dunyi's Tongshu éæ¸ (Penetrating the Scripture of Change) is less well-known than the Taijitu shuo but is no less important for an understanding of Zhou Dunyi's thought. (For a brief account of Zhou Dunyi see the Entry Description of the Taijitu shuo.) The two works are very different in format: the Taijitu shuo is a single coherent essay, while the Tongshu as we have it today (in Zhu Xi's rescension) is composed of forty shorter, aphoristic, mostly independent pieces, each one with a title added by Zhu Xi. Furthermore, the central idea of each -- taiji å¤ªæ¥µ (Supreme Polarity) in the Taijitu shuo and cheng èª  (being authentic) in the Tongshu -- is not found at all in the other. Nevertheless, there are several important overlaps and no significant inconsistencies between the two texts, and I agree with Zhu Xi that they are products of the same author. \"Penetrating the Scripture of Change\" is a loose translation of the title, which more literally means \"penetrating writing\" or \"penetrating the book.\" Zhu Xi averred that the original title was \"Yi tongshu\" æéæ¸, or \"Book Penetrating the Yi,\" and most scholars have accepted that, as the text does refer to and quote the Yijing æç¶ frequently. In fact it contains brief commentaries on nine of the sixty-four hexagrams of the Yi.\n\tWhile the Taijitu shuo is a philosophic cosmogony, situating human beings and in particular sages in the metaphysical and cosmological natural order, the Tongshu focuses in more detail on sagehood. Relying on both the Yijing and the Zhongyong ä¸­åº¸ (Centrality and Commonality), it defines sagehood as \"being authentic\" (cheng). This term, usually but inadequately translated as \"sincerity,\" has both a psychological and metaphysical meaning. On the simplest level it means having consistency between one's inner state and outward behavior. On this level \"sincerity\" is a somewhat superficial but adequate translation. However, even in the Zhongyong it is clear that cheng has a deeper meaning than \"sincerity,\" and for this reason I translate it as \"being authentic,\" in the sense of being real or genuine (shi å¯¦), true to one's innate moral nature (xing æ§) and fully embedded in the Way (dao é), or fully aligned with li ç, the natural/moral order. Another major theme of the Tongshu is the importance of learning (xue å­¸) in the cultivation of sagehood, exemplified by Confucius' favorite disciple, Yan Hui é¡å.",

    "description": "To the south of the Marathon plain, in the little marsh known as Mikro Elos or Brexiza, between the Agrieliki mountain and the sea, and at the borders between the modern villages of Marathon and Nea Makri, lies the so-called Sanctuary of the Egyptian Gods. The sanctuary has the form of a precinct and consists of two connected courtyards built in a marshy area with manmade canals. The main court consists of the temple enclosed by an almost quadrilateral peribolos. In the middle of each side, oriented to the four cardinal points, there is an entrance in the form of an Egyptian pylon. Each doorway is framed by four statues â two male and two female â on high bases. The four statues that decorated each entrance pylon, two internally and two externally, represent Isis and Osiris. This combination of male and female creates an arrangement that emphasizes the Egyptian origins of the cult, reminiscent of the reliefs in the pylons of the Egyptian temples. These entrances lead through a paved walkway to the central construction of the sanctuary, a terrace with a cryptoporticus and an upper structure probably in the shape of a pyramid, perhaps alluding to the formation of an Egyptian landscape. Herodes Atticus was the man that commissioned the building of the sanctuary in the mid-second century CE and, according to Philostratus, facilitated his teaching and philosophical activities in the area. The sanctuary preserves representations of Isis, Osiris, Horus as a falcon, sphinxes but also busts of the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius. In addition, the presence of large ritual lamps attests to processions and rituals in order to honor the deities.",

    "description": "Xing zi ming chu æ§èªå½åº, or Natural Dispositions come from Endowment, is a most-debated bamboo manuscript from the Guodian é­åº corpus, named after the village where the tomb that contained this material was located (modern Hubei, China). The tomb was scientifically excavated in 1993 after being looted, and is dated to the beginning of the third century BCE. The corpus includes manuscripts of the Laozi èå­ (or Dao de jing éå¾·ç¶), the Ziyi ç·è¡£ (now a chapter in the Liji ç¦®è¨), and other previously unattested texts. All these manuscripts are written in Chu æ¥ script and predate the standardization of the script that took place during the Qin ç§¦ dynasty (221â202 BCE), thus constituting vital evidence for the study of Old Chinese language (scripts and reconstructions). \n_____\nAfter the publication of the Guodian corpus in 1998, Xing zi ming chu immediately attracted worldwide scholarly attention for its content. According to this manuscript, xing æ§ (generally translated as \"human nature\") can be described as a set of natural dispositions shared by all members of the same species. Xing zi ming chu further details the origin of qing æ (âemotionsâ), and how human nature and emotions respond to forms of stimulation such as music (le æ¨), rituals (li ç¦®), and externalities (wu ç©). These were all subjects of animated debates during the Warring States era (475â221 BCE); there are in fact several intertextual parallels that can be highlighted between Xing zi ming chu and other texts related to the period. Differently from other discussions of human nature that emerged during the Warring States, Xing zi ming chu is not a treatise with one or more arguments. Rather, it collects statements concerning the topics just listed, with several echoes of other discussions of human nature now part of the body of transmitted literature (such as Mengzi å­å­, Xunzi èå­, Zhuangzi èå­, Lushi chunqiu åæ°æ¥ç§).\n_____\nA second wave of enthusiasm for this text took place shortly after 2001, when a group of bamboo manuscripts that appeared on the Hong Kong market in 1994 and were purchased by the Shanghai Museum began to be published. Among these, a manuscript titled by the editors Xing qing lun æ§æè« (Discussions on Natural Dispositions and Emotions) parallels some of the content of Xing zi ming chu. The texts have been generally ascribed as close to the Confucian or Ru å tradition, although uncertainties remain concerning their exact positions within intellectual lineages, if any. \n_____\nThe manuscripts has been addressed variously: as one coherent unit, as two texts (pian ç¯) addressing the same topics, or explored in sections, especially those that resonate most with texts from the body of transmitted literature. In spite of almost twenty years of scholarship on it and the recovery of the Xing qing lun, there are many residual uncertainties about this text, in particular the interpretation of graphs. This poses many questions concerning the nature of this manuscript, who produced it and for what purpose. Unfortunately, being the tomb looted before archeologists could get to it, much of its material artifacts that may have provided useful information was taken. Motivations behind the burial of texts in tombs also remain subject to debate. While the impressive amount of manuscripts from the Warring States period being recovered moved the conversations onto these new collections, the Guodian corpus remains a principal body of material for the understanding of manuscript culture in ancient China, one to which scholars will return to continuously.",

    "description": "The Lunyu è«èª, generally translated as The Analects, is a collection of sayings by or attributed to Confucius å­å­ (traditional dates 551â479 BCE), a ritual master who lived during the Eastern Zhou æ±å¨ dynasty (770â221 BCE). These dialogues, often very brief and generic, were understood as indications on how to conduct oneself properly in society. A significant change that emerges from the Lunyu is the use of junzi åå­ (literally meaning âson of a lordâ) to indicate a person who acts morally, regardless of birth (Goldin 2020: 49). This is tied to what seems a guiding principle in the Lunyu, in spite of its lack of a sustained argument. Many of the sayings attempt to establish a moral system that takes humans as yardstick, and leaves the veneration of spirits on the side. Some of the central virtues are humanity (ren ä»), morality (yi ç¾©), and reciprocity (shu æ). Yet, Confucius avoids giving any hard definition for any of these (Goldin 2020: 39, 41), for reasons unknown. Precisely because of the generic nature of these statements, a plethora of commentaries and interpretations has been and continues to be produced. \n\nConfuciusâ influence on the contemporaneous and following generations is attested primarily in two ways: one, his views are object of debate among other intellectuals. Most famously, Mozi å¢¨å­ criticized ideas attributed to Confucius, while Mengzi å­å­ and Xunzi èå­ included them in their own philosophical systems. Secondly, his sayings circulated across time and space, as archeological recoveries indicate: sections of the Lunyu dating to first century BCE have been recovered in modern North Korea at Pyongyang, in Dingzhou, China (both discussed in van Els 2018), and in what constituted the north-west frontier of the Han empire (Sanft 2019). \n\nWhat we read today is based on a 17th century edition by Jin Pan éè , based on the Lu é­¯ Lunyu, one of the three major editions of this text mentioned by the Treatise on Arts and Letters èæå¿, the oldest extant bibliography included in the Book of Han æ¼¢æ¸. The other two versions are the Qi é½ Lunyu, and the gu Lunyu å¤è«èª, so named because it was written in ancient script, guwen å¤æ. According to the Shiji å²è¨, the guwen Lunyu was recovered in the wall of the once house of Confucius, when Prince Liu Yu åé¤ (d. 127 BCE) demolished parts of it to expand it during the second century BCE. The Treatise further lists nine more textual lineages (jia å®¶) for this text, which are named after the scholars who taught them. It remains unclear if the differences rested in the content or the interpretations of these scholars. With the starting of the Han dynasty, the Qi and Lu Lunyu continued to circulate while others stopped being mentioned. \nAlthough it was elevated to a classic only during the Tang å dynasty (618â907), the Lunyu was already influential during the Han æ¼¢ dynasty (206 BCEâ220 CE). While of the Pyongyang Lunyu only a cursory study has been made available to scholars, studies on the Dingzhou Lunyu suggest that still by 50 BCE, the Lunyu was not a closed collection yet. Two more discoveries will cast more light on the subject: a cache of looted manuscripts purchased by the Anhui University in 2015, which includes philosophical writings with some parallels to the Lunyu (yet to be published), and the scientifically excavated material from the tomb of the Marquis of Hai Hun æµ·æå¾. This was the title taken by Liu He åè³ (?â59BCE) after being deposed in 74 BCE. Initial publications on the Hai Hun texts describe 500 very poorly preserved strips of Lunyu material, including the chapter Zhi dao ç¥é. The Zhi dao is one of the two chapters (the other being the Wen wang åç) that, according to Ban Gu ç­åº, characterized Qi Lunyu. However, the manuscript does not include the Wen wang, hence editors are reluctant to identify it as an exemplar of the Qi tradition. Furthermore, given the presence of other otherwise unattested chapters, they speculate on whether this may be a personal selection of chapters made by Liu He or his teacher. In support of this idea, the editors indicate that the material features of this manuscript suggest that the chapters were circulating independently, and that there is no reference to it as the Lunyu (the editors use the expression âHai Hunhou Lunyuâ as a matter of convenience, Zhu Fenghan æ±é³³ç 2020). What this exactly entails for the textual history of the Lunyu remains open to debate, one that must await the publication of the Hai Hunhou corpus.",

    "description": "The Shangshu å°æ¸ (Exalted Writings; also known as Book of Documents) is one of the foundational texts in Chinese history, and with a most complex textual history, as recorded in Han æ¼¢ dynasty (202BCEâ220CE) documents. This text is a collection of speeches attributed to rulers and important ministers of the Zhou å¨ dynasty (1046â256 BCE). It became one of the Five Classics äºç¶ during the Han dynasty (see Nylan 2001), i.e. one of the texts on which the imperial curriculum was based. Knowledge of these classics was prerequisite to assume any official position. While some chapters were put together after the fall of the Han dynasty, almost half of it are genuine compositions of early date, and present very challenging language. Wang Guowei çåç¶­, a most experienced scholars in the study of Chinese classics, admitted to understanding no more than half of them, and that it is true of previous scholars too,ãè©©ããæ¸ã(...) æ¼å­èä¸­æé£è®ãä»¥å¼ä¹æéï¼æ¼ãæ¸ãæä¸è½è§£èæ®åä¹äºï¼æ¼ãè©©ãäº¦åä¹ä¸äºãæ¼¢é­ä»¥ä¾è«¸å¤§å¸«æªåä¸å¼·çºä¹èªªï¼ç¶å¶èªªçµä¸å¯éï¼ä»¥æ¯ç¥å¤±åäº¦ä¸è½è§£ä¹ã(In Guantang jilin è§å éæ). \t\n____\t\nOne of the loci classici to begin to understand the history of this text is the Treatise on Arts and Letters èæå¿, the oldest extant bibliography included in the Book of Han æ¼¢æ¸. In there, the Shangshu is presented as originally of 100 chapters (pian ç¯) and a preface, of which only 28 survived. Han scholar Fu Sheng ä¼ç (active second century BCE) is credited with having saved these 28 chapters from the burning of the books that occurred during the Qin ç§¦ dynasty (221â202 BCE), to which another one, the Taishi å¤ªèª, was added. These became known as jin wen ä»æ chapters, because they were written in clerical script (in use during the Han dynasty). However, Fu Sheng was an official serving under the Qin, thus belonging to a category that could possess books. Hence this narrative poses a contradiction on why he needed to hide this text at all. 16 more chapters were recovered from in the wall of the once house of Confucius, when Prince Liu Yu åé¤ (d. 127 BCE) started construction to enlarge it. These were written in a script that preceded the standardization of the script ordered by Qin minister Li Si ææ¯ (circa 280â208 BCE), and became thus known as guwen Shangshu å¤æå°æ¸ (ancient script Shangshu). The Treatise seems to imply that a witch trial interrupted the establishment of an office for the study of these newly recovered chapters. In his memorial to Emperor Ai å (r. 7â1 BCE), Liu Xin åæ­ calls for the establishment of a boshi åå£« (âeruditeâ) position for the study of all texts in ancient, suggesting that these 16 guwen chapters were located in the imperial library. After this reference, we lose track of these 16 chapters. While the Book of Han most certainly refers to it as a somewhat defined collection, the Records of the Historian (which mentions a total of 68 chapters) seems to be using the term also to indicate a category of writing. \n____\t\nWhile Liu Xinâs collated edition of jinwen and guwen chapters seems to have remained within the library, the 29 jinwen chapters enjoyed wider readership, and were frequently referred to as Shangshu. As for many other texts during the Han dynasty, the Shangshu too presents different lineages and scholars who taught this text, most famously Ouyang Gao æ­é½é«, Xiahou Sheng å¤ä¾¯å and his nephew Xiahou Jian å¤ä¾¯å»º. Thus, in the body of Han literature we have references to the Ouyang Shangshu æ­é½å°æ¸, the Da Xiahou Shangshu å¤§å¤ä¾¯å°æ¸ and the Xiao Xiahou Shangshu å°å¤ä¾¯å°æ¸, however without extensive details on the textual differences that existed among these lineages. Of these, the Ouyang Shangshu was the most renown, and one for which one textual change is mentioned: Ouyang divided the Pangeng ç¤åº chapters into three parts (as we still read it today), making it into a 31-chapter Shangshu.\n____\t\nThe next central figure for the history of the Shangshu is that of Du Lin ææ (first CE), who made a lacquer edition of the Shangshu in 29 chapters. Because this edition was written in ancient script, it became known as Guwen Sangshu å¤æå°æ¸. This led to the mistaken assumption that his edition included the 16 guwen chapters found in the first century BCE. These 29 chapter Shangshu eventually reached Mei Ze æ¢è³¾ (fl. Beginning fourth century CE), the Easter Jin æ±æ dynasty scholar who is responsible for the shape of the Shangshu in 58 chapters that we see today. After reorganizing the 29 chapters into 33, he fabricated (wei å½) the remaining chapters on the basis of older material and quotations in other texts. In fact, there is no evidence a single person was responsible for all the fabricated chapters. However, it is plausible that he was the one who eventually presented this 58 chapter Shangshu to the Jin court. While Song å® scholars raised some eyebrows about language used in the chapters that Mei Ze composed, the Shangshu remained by and large unquestioned, until Yan Ruoqu é»è¥ç© (1636â1704) and Hui DongÂ æ æ£ (1697â1758) identified the chapters added by Mei Ze as fabrications, showing their inconsistencies and linguistic mistakes. \n____\t\nA new chapter in the history of the Shangshu is being now written, following the recovery of bamboo manuscripts, in particular those now part of the Tsinghua University æ¸è¯å¤§å­¸ collection. Among these manuscripts, several bear titles similar to titles of Shangshu chapters that were listed as lost during the Han Dynasty, such as the Fu Yue zhi ming åèªªä¹å½; others are written in what is now called shu æ¸ style (Allan 2012), such as the Feng xu zhi ming å°è¨±ä¹å½, the Zhi zheng zhi dao æ²»æ¿ä¹é, and the Si gao åå¿. As with many of the recently recovered manuscripts, scholars lively debate on the nature of these manuscripts. The initial publication (Qinghua daxue cang Zhanguo zhu jian æ¸è¯å¤§å­¸èæ°åç«¹ç°¡) identified many of these manuscripts as the de facto lost chapters of the Shangshu, including those not mentioned by Han texts. More recent scholarship has started to propose different interpretations on the nature of these manuscripts: while some resemble polished texts that might as well be originally part of the Shangshu, some manuscripts present mistakes and incongruities that suggest they might have been used as master copies or templates (most recently, Cheng Hao 2020; Jia Lianxiang 2020).",

    "description": "The Taizhou movement was initiated by a salt merchant, Wang Gen çè® (1483-1541), who came from Taizhou æ³°å·in todayâs Jiangsu Province (North Zhili in the Ming). Wang Gen studied in a village school but dropped out after a few years due to poverty. He went to Shandong on business trips with his father. While visiting the Confucius temple in Confuciusâ hometown Qufu, he had an enlightenment experience and became convinced that his own nature and the nature of the sage were identical.\n\nBack in Taizhou, Wang Gen created a centre, where people gathered for singing, meditation as well as a philosophical debate. We find both firewood gatherers and men with the highest examination degree in the movement. Whether women were part of it must wait for further research. After developing his own ideas independently, Wang Gen became a disciple of Wang Yangming (1472-1529) for a while. Therefore, the Taizhou movement is usually seen as part of the larger Wang Yangming movement.\nThe ideas and praxis of the Taizhou movement are heterogeneous. Wang Gen proclaimed the idea of self-respect inspiring many people in his time. This idea is probably one reason why people still are fascinated by Taizhou learning, both in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. The idea of self-respect questioned the traditional Confucian moral values of sacrificing yourself for your ruler and parents. The debates the Taizhou practitioners organized concerned moral questions, such as how to show solidarity with other people. Wang Gen argued that if you do not love and respect yourself, you cannot love and respect others. But he also talked about protecting yourself, which gives the impression that he already intended to create an organization that might be perceived as a threat to society and that their members therefore would need protection. Like many other Neo-Confucians, he was critical of the examination system. Wang Gen, however, went further and argued that learning which does not give you a feeling of joy is not true learning. He composed a song called âJoyous learningâ (Lexue Ge æ¨å­¸æ­), where joyous learning is celebrated. Wang Yangming said that the essence of oneâs mind or heart (xin å¿) is joyous. For the Taizhou practitioners, this meant to learn to know oneâs mind and protect oneself. This was done by meditation exercises and social organization. Since the civil examination was of no help for learning to know oneself, Wang Gen forbade his sons to take part in the examinations.\n\nSome of the Taizhou practitioners were more moderate and others more radical. The discussion meetings are linked to the private academies, so free discussions might have started already in the Song dynasty (960-1279). In the Song, the academies were however strictly limited to the officials and people with examination degrees. AWang Yangming opened for spreading the message to simple men and women in the countryside, but it the Taizhou practitioners who realized it. With the Taizhou movement, commoners started to read and interpret the Confucian classics according to their own understanding, something which is similar to the Reformation when common men and women became religiously adult. The freedom of debate amont the Taizhou practitioners created a situation with different and contradicting ideas. Some could for instance argue against Buddhist rituals while others were very open to both Buddhist and Daoist ideas and praxis. As for their rituals, they were less hierarchical than the preceding Neo-Confucian. Rules for sitting, bowing and so on were also less strict.\n\nThanks to charismatic masters, the movement spread over China, from Taizhou in the East to Sichuan in the West, Hebei in the North and Guangdong in the South. Yan Jun é¡é (1504-1596) and He Xinyin ä½å¿é± (1517-1579) made Jiangxi a new centre of the movement but also travelled around spreading the teachings. They confirmed desires, a step that was even more provocative than Wang Gen's idea of self-respect. Yan Jun established an âA hall for coming together in harmonyâ (Cuihe Hui èåæ) and draw up rules for his community compact. He also led a seven-day meditation retreat, which includes breathing and meditation exercises with Daoist characteristics. He Xinyinâs âSociety for collective harmonyâ (Juhe Tang èåå ) was something similar to Yan Junâs society. It was a utopian society aimed at taking care of children, aged, and disabled members on a collective basis. The society organized schooling, capping ceremonies (a rite of passage for boys) and paid for funerals. They furthermore collected taxes within the society and delivered taxes to the authorities collectively. The Taizhou practitioners were famous for caring for their friends, and that applied especially to Yan Jun and He Xinyin. He Xinyin was accused of discarding the Confucian bonds between ruler and subject, father and son, elder and younger brother, husband and wife, only keeping the fifth bond between friends. Interestingly, the word they used for âfriendâ,  tongzhi åå¿, would later be chosen by the communists when translating the Western word âcomradeâ to Chinese. He Xinyin remonstrated when the local authorities imposed extra taxes on his community. This led to his arrest and imprisonment, but thanks to his friends he escaped and would change his name several times and travel from place to place lecturing wherever he went. It is at this time he took the name Xinyin å¿é± â the hidden heart.\nOur knowledge about the Taizhou practitioners comes to a large extent from Huang Zongxiâs é»å®ç¾² (1610-1695) work The Records of Ming Scholars, which was published in 1693. Huang Zongxi was a Ming loyalist and a proponent of the Wang Yangming tradition. Accusations during the early Qing dynasty that Wang Yangming and his movement caused the fall of the Ming led Huang Zongxi to blame the radicals of the Taizhou movement such as Yan Jun and He Xinyin to save the more mainstream Wang Yangming followers. However, reading the work by Huang Zongxi carefully it is clear that he is not without admiration for the Taizhou practitioners. That the school of Wang Yangming would have caused the fall of the Ming dynasty seem to be very unlikely. It had probably to do with totally different reasons such as the military strengths of the Manchu invaders or other more practical issues. \nThe infamous thinker Li Zhi æè´ (1527-1602) was inspired by the Taizhou message, but most Chinese and Western scholars do not regard him as a Taizhou practitioner. Li Zhi mentioned that He Xinyin was his teacher, but this was probably more in the sense of a spiritual teacher. Li Zhi has been called an arch-individualist and he was inspired by He Xinyinâs celebration of desires. However, Li Zhi also regarded Prime Minister Zhang Juzheng å¼µå±æ­£ (1525-1582) as his master, a person who was the opposite of He Xinyin as for ideals and way of life. The hatred between He Xinyin and Zhang Juzheng was mutual. Zhang might even have been the man who ordered the arrest and murder of He Xinyin. In 1579, the same year as He Xinyin was killed, Zhang Juzheng forbade the discussion meetings in the free academies, which was a heavy blow for the whole Wang Yangming movement. Li Zhi was deeply interested in Buddhism and left his family to live in a monastery. His eccentric lifestyle and provocative writings (especially his books \"A book to hide\" and \"A book to burn\") made him a target of harsh criticism. He was imprisoned and accused of immoral behaviour and seduction of peopleâs minds. The sources mention that he committed suicide in prison in 1602, but there are divergent narratives of this suicide already in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and, therefore, how Li Zhi died cannot be verified. Something which however is clear is that this kind of religious movement created great fear among men of power.",

    "description": "SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik (direct exposition of the Bible for widespread benefit) is a devotional text that was used by Korean Catholics from the birth of Korean Catholicism in the late eighteenth century to the modern period, during almost a century of persecution under the ChosÅn (1392-1910) regime. Specific authorship is unknown, but the text is presumed to have been translated communally by early Catholic leaders. \nThe text is a vernacular Korean adaptation of three earlier Chinese Catholic texts (Shengjing zhijie, Shengjing guangyi, and Sheng nian guangyi), which were adapted from European devotional literature. It resembles a Sunday missal, with New Testament passages for each week of the liturgical year accompanied by commentary and prayers, and includes about thirty percent of the four Gospels, with Old Testament passages integrated without citation into many of the commentaries. \nTeaching about Jesus features prominently in the commentaries, and a secondary emphasis is soul salvation and the need for vigilance to attain heaven. Stories about saints and events from early Christian tradition, quotes from notables such as St. Augustine, and even maxims from pagan philosophers such as Seneca also appear. A linguistic feature highlighting the textâs transcultural origin is the occasional presence of a Koreanized European word, such as sibirido sando from the Portuguese espirito Santo (Holy Spirit), or belpâÅ­ng from the Latin verbum (word). \nCourt records of books confiscated during arrests of Catholics suggest the text was widely read as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century. With little access to clergy during the period of persecution, Catholics in hiding relied on hand-transcribed religious texts such as this, read during weekly instruction at secret meeting places. State-sponsored persecution ended after a treaty with France was signed in 1886, and, in 1892, Gustave Mutel, the first bishop appointed to Korea, commissioned a new version of the text. Printed in movable type and renamed SyÅnggyÅng chikhae, Mutelâs version offered the original text tidied of marginal notations and supplemented by an occasional transliterated Greek term. This version was reprinted until 1938, and, along with SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik, appears to have been read by Catholics until the Second Vatican council of 1965. \nAs a product of persecution-era Catholicism, SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik remained distinct from later Bible translations, such as the first Korean translation of the New Testament, produced in China in 1887 by John Ross, a Presbyterian missionary. Thousands of copies of the Ross New Testament circulated in Korea soon afterward as Protestant missions moved to center stage in Koreaâs modernization, while Catholics remained concentrated in rural areas where they had been hiding from decades of persecution. The first complete Four Gospels commissioned by the Catholic Church and produced in 1910 was translated from the Latin Vulgate, and later Catholic and Protestant translations containing both Old and New Testaments were based on the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures. These texts differed from SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik in style and wording as well, due to changes in the Korean language. In effect, used by Korean Catholics alongside newer Bible translations during Koreaâs rapid modernization in the first half of the twentieth century, SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik offered a unique link to the pre-modern, persecution era experience. \nSix hand-transcribed copies of SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik dating from the late nineteenth century remain, archived in Seoul: four at the Church History Research Center, and two at the ChÅltusan Martyrâs Shrine. Each copy consists of eleven tomes bound in four paginated volumes, each volume averaging almost 700 pages, with 65 to 200 characters per page.",

    "description": "Fuzi is the major work of Fu Xuan åç (217-278), an influential official and prolific writer of Wei-Jin times. This work has been listed among the miscellaneous treatises; considering that its core thoughts are Confucian, however, there is still controversy regarding the category of Fuzi. Most parts of Fuzi were written as political advice for Sima Zhao (211-265), posthumously the Emperor Wen of Jin, on how to establish a new regime and manage potential issues such as avoiding riots and selecting talents. This writing purpose to some extent explains why it is hard to categorize Fuzi, as Fu Xuan borrowed and integrated many schoolsâ ideas that were valuable to statecraft, such as legalist law and order, Mohist economical style, Confucian morality and education. Thus, Jordon Paper has claimed that Fu Xuan is âConfucian in theory, semi-Legalist in application of theory.â Regardless which school he belongs to, Fu Xuan proposed several insightful strategies on statecraft. For example, his innovative tax policy combined three principles: fairness, economy, and regularity. He opposed Xuanxueâs specious style and promoted trustworthiness and honesty. He suggested banishing the death penalty to save labourers. He also advocated personal cultivation and virtue (de å¾·) for rulers and officials. Fu Xuanâs strategies and proposals on statecraft have been valued and applied by later scholars and politicians, which can be seen through their efforts to preserve the Fuzi.\n\tAccording to the Jinshu, the Fuzi originally had inner, middle, and outer sections, which included four categories and six records, totaling one hundred and forty pieces, on the following themes: statecrafts, history, and current affairs. The book itself was quite lengthy: it had  several hundred thousand characters and was about one hundred juan long. During the Tang dynasty, the Fuzi was still complete; after the Song, it started to disappear and by Ming times, there was no record of it. \n\tDuring the Qing Dynasty, scholars produced several reconstructed editions of Fuzi. One of these is the Wuyingdian version (Wuying dian juzhen ben æ­¦è±æ®¿èçæ¬), compiled in 1774, which includes twenty-four sections mainly based on the Yonglu dadian æ°¸æ¨å¤§å¸, and forty-eight items (tiao æ¢) in a supplement. This edition was reproduced in the Siku quanshu huiyao ååº«å¨æ¸èè¦ and the Siku quanshu ååº«å¨æ¸. Yan Kejun å´ å¯ å (1762-1843) produced a four juan edition of the Fuzi in his Quan Shanggu saidai Qin Han Sanguo Liuchao wen. In Zhihai ææµ·, in 1843, Qian Xizuo é¢çç¥ formed a three juan edition of Fuzi. This edition is virtually copied in Ye Dehui's èå¾· è¼ (1864-1927) Guangu tang suo zhushu è§å¤å æèæ¸. In 1876, Fang Junshi æ¹æ¿¬å¸« (1830-1889) compiled the Fu Chungu ji: Fu Fuzi Jiaokan ji åé¶è§é : éåå­æ ¡åè¨ in five juan. The first two juan and the supplement are about the Fuzi. \nFuzi has been highly regarded in history. Wang Chen çæ² (d. 266) who, like Fu Xuan, once worked on the Wei shu é­æ¸ (which became part of the Sanguo zhi ä¸åå¿), held the post of Minister of Works å¸ç©º, a leading position for those who excelled in literature. Commenting on the Fuzi he said, \"Examining the book that you [Fu Xuan] have written, Sir, [I find] that your expressions are well reasoned and useful, provide good policies, and preserve and revere the Confucian teachings. They are capable of thwarting the propagation of the philosophies of Yang [Zhu æ¥æ±] and Mo [Di å¢¨ç¿] and equal the philosophies of Xun [Zi èå­] and Mencius of past generations.\"  During the Tang Dynasty, the prominent official and historian, Wei Zheng é­å¾µ (580-643), confirmed the Confucian values of Fuzi by selecting some of its chapters about government and politics for inclusion in his book Qunshu zhiyao ç¾¤æ¸æ²»è¦. The editors of the Siku quanshu ååº«å¨æ¸ regarded the Fuzi as a Confucian work and acclaimed it in their Zongmu tiyao ç¸½ç®æè¦: \"[The extant works of Jinâs philosophers consist of only Fu Xuanâs book; all of its discussions concern governing principles and explain Confucian teachings. [His] ingenious intentions and excellent speeches are everywhere. Thus, [I] believe both Lunheng and Changyan are inferior to this book. The book [contains] incomplete chapters and broken slips volumes. If we gather together its extant pieces, we still can examine and discover one-tenth [of its meanings]. This is indeed valuable.â",

    "description": "The Amduat is a pictorialâtextual composition which describes the nocturnal voyage of the sun-god and his entourage through the subterranean underworld, where he unites with the underworld god Osiris (representing an \"engendering principle\") and is rejuvenated before being reborn from the eastern horizon at dawn, re-enacting the original moment of cosmic creation.\n\nThe original title of the composition was the \"Writing/Drawing of the Hidden Space\". The common scholarly designation \"Amduat\" renders the generic Egyptian term \"scroll of that which is in the underworld\", which was assigned to later copies of this and several other compositions.\n\nThe tomb of Thutmose III (KV 34 in the Valley of the Kings in ancient Thebes, on the west bank of the Nile near modern Luxor) contains the earliest extant full copy of the composition in all three of its versions: a \"long\" version that combines descriptive text with images of entities inhabiting the underworld; a \"short\" version, without images, which summarizes the events of each hour; and a tabular \"catalogue\" (also termed an \"index\") of captioned figures appearing in the long version. The tomb of Thutmose III provides the only known example of the catalogue.\n\nIn the tomb of Thutmose III, the \"long\" and \"short\" versions of the Amduat are inscribed on the walls of the oval burial chamber in the tomb. The \"catalogue\" is inscribed on the walls of the antechamber leading to the burial chamber.\n\nThe \"long\" and \"short\" versions are divided into 12 sections, each describing (and depicting, in the case of the \"long\" version) the activities of the sun-god and his interactions with various underworld inhabitants in a region of the underworld. One region is traversed in each hour of the night between sunset and sunrise.\n\nThe Amduat is part of a broader category of cosmographic compositions termed \"underworld books\" or \"netherworld books\". Other members of this category include the Book of Gates, Book of Caverns, Books of the Earth, and the Enigmatic Books of the Solar-Osirian Unity. Closely related compositions are the cosmographic Book of the Day, Book of the Night, Book of Nut (also known as the Blueprint of the Course of the Stars), and the non-cosmographic Book of Adoring Re in the West (also known as the Litany of Re). Complementing these was a composition now termed the \"cult-theological treatise\" or \"king as sun-priest\" text, which has a similar focus on esoteric religious knowledge. All these compositions are known mainly from New Kingdom sources (mid- to late 2nd millennium BCE), with later copies from the 1st millennium BCE; some of them, such as the Amduat, Litany of Re, and cult-theological treatise, may have originated in the Middle Kingdom (early to mid-2nd millennium BCE), although the topic of dating continues to be debated.\n\nAlmost all New Kingdom copies of the Amduat come from royal tombs. The only known non-royal example is from the tomb of the vizier (highest-ranking administrative official in the Egyptian government) Useramun, who served under Thutmose III. Access to and circulation of the composition and/or its content remains debated. It likely originated in initiatory rituals for a restricted group, before being secondarily deployed in tombs due to its solar themes, which fit with intensive developments in solar theology (including hymns and ritual texts) and its mortuary significance during the early New Kingdom.",

    "description": "Zhou Dunyi å¨æ¦é ¤ (1017-1073) has, since the late 12th century, been considered the \"founding father\" of the Song dynasty revival of Confucianism, which in the West has been called \"Neo-Confucianism.\" Curiously, though, it took over a century for him to acquire that status, which was conferred on him primarily by Zhu Xi æ±ç¹ (1130-1200), the chief architect of the Cheng-Zhu school of Confucianism (named after Zhu and his predecessor Cheng Yi ç¨é ¤ [1033-1107]). Although Zhou Dunyi was fairly obscure during his lifetime and had very few students to pass on his teachings, Zhu Xi found Zhou's concept of taiji å¤ªæ¥µ (Supreme Polarity or Supreme Ultimate) useful in linking together the metaphysical and cosmological dimensions of his (Zhu's) system of thought and practice (see Adler, Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi). Thus, ever since the end of the 12th century, histories of Neo-Confucianism, in both East Asia and the West, have begun with Zhou Dunyi. \n\tZhou Dunyi's Taijitu shuo å¤ªæ¥µåèªª, or Discussion of the Taiji Diagram, accompanied by the diagram itself, is his most famous and influential work. The diagram was attributed to a 10th-century Daoist adept, Chen Tuan é³æ¶ (d. 989). According to Zhu Zhen æ±é (1072-1138) it was passed down to Zhou Dunyi through two generations of Chen Tuan's students â a transmission that has never been confirmed. In Daoist circles the Diagram seems to have been read from the bottom up as a guide to inner contemplation of the Dao within the human body, with phrases from the Xici ç¹«è¾­ (Appended Remarks) or Dazhuan å¤§å³ (Great Treatise) appendix of the Yijing æç¶ (Scripture of Change) labeling the various stages. \n\tZhou Dunyi, in his \"Discussion,\" read the Diagram from the top down as a cosmogonical representation, from an undifferentiated unity to the interaction of yin é° and yang é½, to further differentiation into the Five Phases (wuxing äºè¡), and ultimately to the myriad things. The second half of the Discussion presents the Confucian sage as the culmination of this cosmological process. Under the influence of Zhu Xi and his many students and followers, the Diagram and Discussion became the basis of Neo-Confucian cosmology, and Zhou Dunyi became universally accepted as the first Confucian sage of the Song dynasty; in fact the first true sage since Mencius in the 4th century BCE. The Diagram and Discussion are also found in the Daozang éè, or Daoist Canon.",

    "description": "There are three sanctuaries dedicated to the Egyptian deities (Isis, Serapis, Anubis, Harpocrates, Osiris, Bubastis) in Delos. The first one is Sarapieion A and consists of a court and a small temple built on a vault accessible to water, two rooms of which one had benches, probably for the gatherings, and a portico. There is a long inscription known as the âchronic of the Sarapieionâ and gives information about the origins of the sanctuary. According to this inscription, the founder of the sanctuary was the priest Apollonios; his grandfather Apollonios was the one who brought his god with him when he arrived from Memphis. Serapis appeared in a dream appointing where the sanctuary had to be built. It was probably private, and the office of the priest was hereditary. The Sarapieion B was not far from the previous one. It was constructed on a small terrace. It has been preserved only in ruins, and it once had a court, spaces with benches, a small temple, a tank, and altars. Unfortunately, not much is known about the history of the sanctuary. The Sarapieion C was the official sanctuary, the most important, and covered a large space from north to south on a terrace on the upper part of the tank of Inopos. It was close to the Sanctuary of the Syrian deities. The sanctuary was divided into two parts. A trapezoidal space with a paved road framed by altars and small sphinxes covers the south part. At the north, there is a paved court which is surrounded by cultic buildings: temples dedicated to Isis, Serapis, Anubis, and other buildings. Delos is the site that has offered the largest number of inscriptions dedicated to the Egyptian deities outside Egypt. These inscriptions reveal essential information on the offices; the sanctuary was served by a priest, a keykeeper, a Î½ÎµÏÎºÏÏÎ¿Ï chosen among the citizens, an á¼ÏÎµÏÎ±Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï who proclaimed the miracles of the god, an á½Î½ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿ÎºÏÎ¯ÏÎ·Ï who interpreted the dreams etc. The same inscriptions enlighten on the customs and rules that devotees had to follow: wine was forbidden for the worshipers of Isis and Osiris, wool clothes were not allowed for the worshipers of Serapis. The inscriptions also suggest that the deities were venerated under numerous forms: Isis Hathor, Isis close to the Mother of Gods Astarte, Isis Tyche, Isis Aphrodite, Isis Nike, Isis protector of maritime activities, Isis Dikaiosyne.",

    "description": "During the reign of Han Emperor Wu (141 â 87 BCE), the imperial government sponsored the worship of a large number of cults, many of which were connected to the emperorâs pursuit of immortality. Many of these cults were inherited from earlier, Qin, practice, others were adopted from regional cults of the former Warring States, and others were entirely new. Rather than being a formalized group of religious specialists/practitioners, Emperor Wuâs imperial cult, meaning cults sponsored by the emperor, is better understood as a collection of religious practices, which were brought together under the auspices of the Han court, in order to access powerful spirits for both the emperor and his empire. The cults worshipped by the emperor, or on his behalf, were spread out across the empire, and the emperor frequently travelled to perform sacrifices or visit sacred locations.\nThe number of cults grew over the course of Emperor Wuâs reign, and there were frequent changes to sacrificial locations and sacrificial rites. This period of imperial cult is thus characterized by experimentation rather than as a coherent cult with a standardized pantheon.\nEmperor Wuâs pursuit of cult was closely connected to his pursuit of immortality as well as to his imperial ambitions â the two cannot be separated. We cannot say for certain what type of immortality the emperor pursued, whether it was the avoidance of death altogether or transcendence, or some combination of the two. It is evident that the emperor believed that one of the clearest paths to immortality could be found by emulating the sage rulers of antiquity, particularly the legendary Yellow Thearch é»å¸, Yao å ¯, Shun è, and Yu ç¦¹, as well as following precedent set by the First Emperor of Qin.  Significantly, the emperor believed that it was important for him to rule over a unified territory in order to perform the legendary Feng å° and Shan ç¦ª sacrifices, which he was told, were performed by the Yellow Thearch before he became an immortal. As such, the emperor took over control of territory containing important cult locations, removing regional lords è«¸ä¾¯ and kings ç from governing over territories containing the Five Sacred Peaks äºå¶½. The emperor also attempted to access the powers of local spirits, mostly in the eastern parts of the empire, to not only access their mantic powers, but to demonstrate his authority over the spirits and land of the empire. Emperor Wu sought the advice on spiritual affairs from both within his own court and by recruiting outsiders who claimed access to mantic knowledge. These outsiders, whom Sima Qian classifies as Fangshi æ¹å£« (Masters of Methods), claimed to have specialized knowledge about immortality. Sima Qian, and others, were highly critical of the emperorâs reliance on these Fangshi, and many of the cults that they established were disbanded after the emperorâs death.\nWe have no information about the practice of these cults when the emperor was not involved, nor if they continued in some form after the period of imperial patronage.",

    "description": "Aceh enjoys a reputation as Indonesiaâs âVerandah of Mecca,â a place of special piety and devotion to Sunni Islam.  With the confirmed presence of Muslims in the region by the 13th century, Aceh gave rise to one of the oldest Islamic kingdoms in Southeast Asia and emerged by the 1600s as a center of Muslim scholarship during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda and several female âsultanahâ successors.  After the Dutch colonial invasion of the sultanate, Acehnese Muslims leapt to the forefront of religiously inspired resistance against colonialism during the long Dutch-Aceh War (1873-1914), forged vibrant Islamic schools during the 20th century, and claimed âspecial autonomyâ status in matters of religious administration in the aftermath of their incorporation into the newly independent Indonesian nation-state in 1945.  Since the end of Suhartoâs âNew Orderâ regime in 1998, Aceh continues to forge ahead with the implementation of a distinctive Islamic legal and bureaucratic system (Syariat Islam) as part of its special autonomy status. Within this general framework of Sunni Islamic piety, Acehnese Muslims have embraced varied religious practices, textual traditions, political affiliations and approaches to the interpretation of Islamic law.\n\n**Special thanks to Daniel Birchok of the University of Michigan-Flint for his valuable feedback on the entry",

    "description": "This entry aims to document Zichiji, a commentary of Dharmaguptaka Vinaya (Buddhist monastic rules) written by Yuanzhao (1048-1116). Zichiji is a secondary commentary based on a root commentary of Daoxuanâs (596-667) SifenlÃ¼ shanfan buque xingshichao (Xingshichao). Divided into 16 volumes, it is a complete commentary of Daoxuanâs original work, which is based on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. Like Xingshichao, Zichiji refers to various Vinaya-related texts and Buddhist materials and is intended to be used as a comprehensive guide to the Buddhist monastic way of living. Zichiji covers a wide range of monastic practices and management, such as ordination ritual, repentance ritual, funerary practices, daily management of the monastery, and the relationships with laypersons. Unlike Xingshichao, it includes valuable information on the Song Buddhist monasticism and Yuanzhaoâs debate with other Vinaya masters in his time. In terms of the transmission history of the text, multiple historical sources record that Zichiji was canonized during the Southern Song period. However, we do not have a material copy of any Buddhist canon which contains this text. The current canonization of the Zichiji can only be traced to the modern compilation of ZokuzÅkyÅ in 1902. The popularity of Zichiji is a symbolic mark for the beginning of an institutionalized Vinaya school in China. A litter earlier than Zichiji, Yunkanâs Huizhengji (not extant) was a parallel work circulated in the Northern Song. Yuanzhao and Yunkan demonstrated different interpretations of Daoxuan and the Vinaya. After the Yuan Dynasty, Zichiji, together with other commentaries written by Yuanzhao, did not survive in the continent. It has been preserved in multiple monastic libraries and archives in Japan, such as Otani University library, Seikado Bunko Library, and Kanazawa Library, and brought back to China in the modern period. The preservation of Zichiji bespeaks active Buddhist communication and exchange on the Vinaya between China, Korea, and Japan in the medieval period during the 12th-14th centuries. Exchange among different countries became possible together with the reopening of the maritime trade route interrupted by the end of the Tang and the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Zichiji was studied in Japan as one of the foundational commentaries for the Vinaya and thus facilitated the Vinaya revival movement in Kamakura Japan. Yuanzhao, as the author of Zichiji, was commemorated as one of the patriarchs of the Vinaya school. In the modern period, Chinese Vinaya master Hongyi wrote an annotated version of Zichiji, and it has been further edited and published in China.",

    "description": "Catholicism first entered Joseon Korea in the early seventeenth century through books written by Western missionaries and their Chinese colleagues brought back by Koreans who had traveled to Beijing as part of government tribute missions. While some Korean scholars were interested in the science and technology contained in those books, they rejected the religion. However, in the latter part of the eighteenth century some reform-oriented scholars who questioned traditional Neo-Confucianism began to take Catholicism more seriously, leading to the baptism of one of their number, Peter Yi Seunghun, in 1784. He would return to Korea and begin to baptize others, so that when the first priest (a native of China) entered the country in 1794, there were already several thousand Catholics, including members of all ranks of society. Though these first Korean Catholics were heavily influenced by Confucianism, for instance, hoping that Godâs grace would help them become more filial children, the Catholic rejection of ancestor rites and challenging of traditional class and gender hierarchy with notions of spiritual equality, as well as their connection with foreigners, would lead to massive state-sponsored persecutions that would kill thousands between the late eighteen and nineteenth centuries. Though the opening of Korea in the last quarter of the nineteenth century led to the petering out of anti-Catholic violence, the Korean Catholic community would remain on the margins of society (and would face nearly complete destruction in the north following national division) until beginning around the 1960s when growth in the number of laity, nuns, monks, and priests; reforms from the Second Vatican Council that allowed the use of the vernacular language and other similar changes; increased educational and medical work; and highly visible participation in the democratization movements, led to a high level of familiarity and respect among non-Catholic Koreans. For instance, Cardinal Stephen Kim Suhwan would publicly challenge the dictator Park Chunghee for his violation of human rights and Thomas More Kim Dae Jung in 1996 was a key leader in the democratization movement and his election to the presidency marked the triumph of democracy in the Republic of Korea as it involved the peaceful transfer of authority between a party in power and one that had been out of power. While Catholicism has sufficient numbers and respect to make it highly visible in Korea, like other religions it is being impacted by demographic decline. Moreover, while considered progressive on issues of democratization, as issues of sexual morality are increasingly becoming objects of debate in Korea, the traditionalist stance of the Catholic Church might lead it to have more conflict with society. As in other parts of the world, Catholic devotional life focuses on such practices as attendance at Mass, reception of the sacraments, and recitation of the rosary. Notable characteristics include the comparatively larger choirs in parish churches (Korean Catholics tend to be excellent and exuberant singers), the importance of domestic pilgrimage (made possible by the large number of holy sites created by persecution), interest in saints (again, a product of persecution), and the dignified solemnity of liturgical practices (which are in part an inheritance from Confucianism).",

    "description": "Tutankhamun reigned as king of Egypt from about 1334-1325 BCE, in what has come to be referred to by scholars as the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom. Tutankhamun seems to have died unexpectedly, and the cause of his death has received significant speculation. While this king is one of the most famous individuals from the long history of ancient Egypt, it is not due to fantastic feats or accomplishments. Indeed, Tutankhamun did not reign very long and accomplished relatively little. He is famous instead, because of his tomb. His tomb is the only well preserved, (mostly) intact royal tomb from ancient Egypt. It is located in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes. Discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, this tomb was filled with an incredibly rich hoard of treasure. It was given the designation \"KV 62\" as tomb number 62 in the King's Valley. The tomb and its treasures, while also serving as examples of the abilities of Egypt's skilled craftspeople and artists, also provide extensive information about religious beliefs and practices during this era.",

    "description": "In the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1070 BC), the ancient Egyptians colonized Nubia, the area which today comprises the south of Egypt from Aswan and the north of Sudan until Khartoum. Egyptologists have traditionally believed that, in this period, Nubians had been 'Egyptianized'. This presupposed that Nubians fully adopted Egyptian culture, consequently converting to Egyptian religion. In the New Kingdom, following an initial period of military expansion and conquest, the ancient Egyptians reoccupied previously built fortresses in Lower Nubia and erected temple-towns across Lower and Upper Nubia. These temple-towns included a temple and other cultic spaces, administrative and housing areas and associated cemeteries. Evidence for religion in New Kingdom colonial Nubia comes from three different levels: the temple (state religion), houses/workshops/magazines (personal piety) and cemeteries (mortuary beliefs and practices). From an archaeological viewpoint, an overall substitution of local Nubian to Egyptian styles and patterns is apparent. However, today, archaeology is revealing a more complex context of cultural interactions between Egyptian colonisers and Nubian populations, including negotiations of identities and cultural entanglements. Moving away from previous colonial perspectives based on ideas such as acculturation, today archaeologists emphasize Nubian agency in the adoption, choice, refusal and maintenance of cultural patterns, which includes religious affiliation. Therefore, it remains hard to determine whether local populations converted to Egyptian religion or not, especially as today we accept that artefacts behave in different ways independently of how they look like. Egyptian-style temples, houses and material culture offer us glimpses of religious experiences in New Kingdom colonial Nubia. However, only a contextual approach allows us to detect religious affiliations in the light of complex and diverse processes of cultural perpetuity and change in colonial Nubia.\nTemples were dedicated to Egyptian deities, most importantly Amun-Ra (e.g., Jebel Barkal), but also Hathor (e.g., Mirgissa), Horus (e.g., Buhen), the deified pharaoh (e.g., Soleb temple didicated to Neb-Maat-Ra, Lord of Nubia) and even the Aten during the Amarna Period (evidence from Sedeinga, Sai, Sesebi and Kawa). Around 50 temples dedicated to Egyptian deities were found in Nubia. Temple ritual involved offerings to the gods (based on iconography), including incense and food (conical bread moulds are usually associated with temples) and votive offerings to Hathor at Mirgissa. Sai has been suggested as a solar cult centre: a non-funerary pyramid located in the New Kingdom cemetery on the island has been interpreted as a solar temple. Priests and other personnel associated with temples in New Kingdom Nubia lived in settlements across the Middle Nile and are known from titles on inscribed objects and architectural remains from settlements and cemeteries. Beyond cultic spaces, New Kingdom temples in Nubia also included a series of functional areas.\nEvidence for household religion includes pottery (incense burners with resin and offering platters), faience bowls potentially associated with domestic shrines, ancestor busts (which suggest a similar practice to Egyptian ancestor cult at home), female figurines usually assciated with fertility rituals, and various amulets/pendants representing deities etc. Animal figurines (namely cattle), typically of previous Nubian cultures, are sometimes found at New Kingdom settlements.\nEvidence from cemeteries point to commemoration and memory during funerals, when graves goods would be displayed to the community. Ritual displays would allow people to express cultural affiliation. Offerings of food and beer were placed in tombs, as well as oil/perfume. Animal sacrifices are occasionally found, a typical Nubian practice. Pouring black resin onto bodies, coffins and other objects, including canopic jars, was also part of the funerary ritual. This would point to mummification practices, although no mummified human remains were found in Nubia. Bodies were wrapped and placed in coffins. Remains of shrouds and the position of body members suggest manipulation of the body to fit communities' expectations of death. Grave goods included coffins (not often preserved), jewellery, cosmetic items, tools, and more specialized items such as shabtis and heart scarabs. The Egyptian Book of the Dead usually appears on these objects, but it is difficult to determine if Egyptian mortuary texts in Nubia indicate any Osirian beliefs locally. The position of certain objects around the body and the special placement of amulets in the hands or around the neck of individuals suggest some intention to protect the dead for the afterlife.",

    "description": "Sino-Muslims in Qing China refers to Chinese-speaking Muslims who were natives in China proper and regular subjects of the Qing state. Their history can be traced back to the Tang dynasty (618-907) when Arabic and Persian merchants began to sojourn in Chinaâs southeastern coastal area for trade. Many stayed and became Chinese subjects. After the Mongol invasion, large numbers of Middle Eastern and Central Asian Muslims further entered China proper during the Yuan period (1271-1368) through military campaigns and commercial activities. By the Qing (1644-1911), after several hundred years of reproduction, intermarriage, adoption, conversion (very limited), and internal migration, Muslims in China proper were already widely dispersed in villages and towns, in counties, prefectures, and provinces throughout the territory. In 1910, they had an estimated population of four to seven million.\nDwelling together with their non-Muslim (mostly Han Chinese) neighbors for long, these Muslims spoke Chinese, pursued Confucian social values, and embraced local customs practiced by Han Chinese. The Qing state found it too difficult to grant them with territory-based legal autonomy like what they did to Turkic Muslims and other ethnic minorities in borderlands. They were also not recognized by the state as a distinct category of imperial subjects, and were classified sometimes into the Han Chinese majority, and sometimes into Turkic Muslims. In occasions needing differentiation, the state might vaguely call them neidi huiminåå°åæ° (Muslim subjects in China proper) or hanhuiæ±å (Han Chinese Muslims). For convenience of analysis, contemporary scholars refer to them as âSino-Muslims.â\nDespite their acculturation and their murky visibility in the state, Sino-Muslims in Qing China did not forsake or conceal their Islamic distinction in daily practices. They built mosques and Islamic schools throughout China proper. They travelled around in China proper and formed various types of transregional networks with co-religionists. They also widely published and disseminated Islamic scriptures and books written in the Chinese language. By the early 19th century, dispersed Sino-Muslims had been sharing common memory, knowledge, and discourse, etc. which contributed to a sense of collectivity rising among them, transcending regional differences within China proper. It distinguished them not just from non-Muslims in China proper, but more substantially from Muslims outside China proper. In terms of religious affiliation, most Sino-Muslims in Qing China belonged to Gedimu (the traditional Hanafi school of Sunni Islam in China). A small number of them (primarily in the northwest) began to be converted to Sufi sects since the early Qing period when Sufism was coming into China.",

    "description": "Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was born in third-century Mesopotamia (April 14, 216 AD), which, since 226 AD, was a part of the Sassanian Empire. Living in the pluralistic environment of Mesopotamia, the religion he instituted contains elements of many religious traditions with which he was familiar, such as Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Actually, Mani regarded himself as the last prophet in a long chain of prophets, which included Zoroaster, Buddha, and Christ.\nThe most notable feature of Manichaeism is its dualism. At the foundation of the Manichaean religion lies the doctrine of the two principles (also called roots or natures), which correspond to light and darkness, good and evil, spirit and matter. The Manichaean community itself consisted of two classes: the hearers or catechumens (the lay believers), and the highest echelons of the Manichaean Church, the Elect.\n Mani envisioned that his religion would surpass preceding ones by creating an ecumenical religion that would spread and unite the world.  Indeed, Manichaeism spread very rapidly through land and sea transportation networks, first in the Greco-Roman world (within a century) and later to the east, as far as China. In China, Manichaean communities continued to exist until the seventeenth century. In contrast, to the Roman West, it is argued that (at least as a distinct religious community) Manichaeism did not survive after the 6th century.\nThe current entry focuses on aspects of the religious and social identity and daily life of East-Roman Manichaeans.",

    "description": "The Temple of Confucius (Kong Temple) in Qufu is the principal site for the performance of Confucian ritual. Believed to occupy the home ground of Confucius (Kongzi), the place was maintained and revered through almost the entirety of China's dynastic history.\n \nAccording to tradition the temple was established by Duke Ai of Lu two years after the death of Kongzi and was maintained during the centuries that followed by family members and local scholars. When the Han dynasty adopted Confucianism as a state orthodoxy in the second century BCE the temple began to receive state patronage. Although Kongzi had never belonged to the nobility he was nonetheless granted imperial rites as an \"uncrowned King\". That precedent would give rise to a centuries long debate over how to properly entitle the sage and his family members, and how to properly commemorate them through rites at his temple. Those titles and rites would have a direct impact on the character of the temple as it grew in scale and grandeur to match Kongzi's reputation. The temple was significantly upgraded in the Song dynasty, acquired its current configuration in the Ming dynasty, and reached its maximum extent in the Qing dynasty.\n \nKong Temple in Qufu is the first among many Confucian temples that once stood in virtually every county in China. Although none match the scale of the Qufu temple, all have common features that identify them as part of a wider ritual structure. Confucian temples necessarily include a main courtyard dominated by the Hall of Great Completion (Dachengdian) which holds the spirit tablets of Kongzi and his principal followers. The tablets of other Confucian worthies and notable scholars are arranged in galleries along the sides of the courtyard and the temple may also include memorial space for Kongziâs parents. In Qufu the space includes a pavilion marking the site where Kongzi once taught his students, memorial architecture for his wife, and a display space for a narrative account of his life. Outside of the main gates a succession of courtyards holds hundreds of steles inscribed by emperors and high officials in praise of Kongzi, and a towering library hall that testifies to the scholarly associations of Confucianism. To the east lies the Kong Family ancestral temple and Kong Family mansion.  \n\nWith the collapse of the Qing dynasty in the early 20th century the temple was degraded and lost its ritual function. Narrowly escaping destruction during the Cultural Revolution, the temple has since been rehabilitated as a World Heritage Site. Together with Kong Mansion and the Kong Family cemetery (Kong Forest) Kong Temple remains one of largest and best preserved examples of Chinese ritual architecture.",

This is seen at a number of sites in northern Egypt, but is slowly replaced by the Naqada culture of southern Egypt in what is referred to as the period Naqada IC-IIB. After this, Egypt becomes a unified state.\nMost of this period is devoid of texts, with simple labels showing up right at the end. This means that our religious knowledge for this era is completely based on an interpretation of the material evidence. Many of these interpretations are built on the belief of continuity of practice between this early phase and later Egyptian religion. This is somewhat problematic, as the meaning of objects and practices may have changed over time. There is therefore disagreement on what religion was like in this prehistoric period, which should be kept in mind. As new evidence surfaces, these interpretations may change.",

    "description": "The early Naqada culture of Upper Egypt (in the south), refers to the cultural assemblage found in this area of Egypt during the Predynastic Period. This is what Egyptologists refer to as Naqada I-IIIb, approximately 4000-2950 BCE (though these dates are somewhat debated). Most of this period is devoid of texts, with simple labels showing up right at the end. This means that our religious knowledge for this era is completely based on an interpretation of the material evidence. Many of these interpretations are built on the belief of continuity of practice between this early phase and later Egyptian religion. This is somewhat problematic, as the meaning of objects and practices may have changed over time. There is therefore disagreement on what religion was like in this prehistoric period, which should be kept in mind. As new evidence surfaces, these interpretations may change. For the moment, Egyptologists generally see the Naqada culture as the foundation of what we currently understand to be ancient Egyptian religion. Many of the iconic images of pharaonic power and religion are first seen at this time, and continue to be used for thousands of years. The practices of the Naqada culture people began in the south of Egypt, but during this period they spread north, and replace the Buto-Maadi culture. This is therefore a crucial period in the history of ancient Egyptian religion.",

    "description": "Edom appears to have had two major phases of activity during the Iron Age (1200â550 BCE). Early in the Iron Age activity and social complexity was focused in the lowland regions of the Arabah and centered in large part on the industrial exploitation of copper resources in the region. This period was marked by primarily mobile non-sedentary communities, and as such, lacks substantial textual or settlement data. This entry focusses on the second major phase of Edom, dated to the late Iron Age (ca. 750â550 BCE), where there is substantially more robust data. At this time Edom was centered in the highlands of southern Transjordan around a series of small settlements and agricultural villages, dominated by its foremost city of Busayra. The region yet retained a large mobile pastoral component. Substantial textual sources for this region are lacking, so much of the relevant data derives from short inscriptions and archaeological data. Similarities in lifeways, social structures, etc., between Edom and its neighbors to the north and west (Moab, Ammon, Judah), allows for relevant comparisons and extrapolations to be made, particularly concerning religious practices. Similar to the other Iron Age polities of the southern Levant, many gods are attested in Edom, though the deity Qos (Qaus/Qws) appears to have served as the foremost deity of the land, its populace, and of the ruling elite of Edom. Qos appears to have functioned as a local variant of the âstorm godâ and/or âdivine warriorâ type. Knowledge of Qos is primarily restricted to short inscriptions and names. Evidence for religious practices (to Qos and other deities) can be found in individual homes, at poorly understood regional ritual sites, at several shrines (Horvat Qitmit and En Hazeva) and in a large temple complex at Busayra that likely centered on the worship of Qos and presumably a consort.",

    "description": "Pythagoreanism, like some of the East Asian movements that it eerily recalls, lies somewhere between philosophy, mysticism, and religion. Rooted in the teaching of the sixth century BC philosopher Pythagoras, the movement spread across Southern Italy and eventually into a modest portion of the Greek world, taking with it a strange hodgepodge of beliefs emphasizing ascetism, number symbolism, and the immortality of the soul. \nPythagoras himself was certainly a historical figure. Born on the Aegean island of Samos around the middle of the sixth century BC, Pythagoras migrated to Croton on the boot of Italy around 530. It was there that he founded his school while also playing an important role in the politics of Magna Graecia. Pythagoras is thought to have died in Metapontum, to which he escaped as a refugee after a violent popular backlash directed at him and his followers.\nThough today Pythagoras is often remembered as a man of science and mathematics (primary school students are invariably first exposed to him through the Pythagorean theorem which he discovered), in antiquity and even during his own lifetime he was also very much seen as a âholy man.â He was often identified with the Hyperborean Apollo, was said to have had a golden thigh, and allegedly claimed to remember his previous incarnations. Classical and post-classical authorities depict him acquiring his impressive knowledge and abilities while traveling in Egypt and the East. Such early accounts are almost invariably fanciful â in some legends Pythagoras is said to have proved the immortality of the soul by descending to the underworld â but it is not impossible that an Ionian of the sixth century should have brought together elements of Babylonian mathematics, Persian religion, and Indian philosophical doctrines.\nThe Pythagorean life was based on strict rules that regulated all aspects of existence from diet and clothing to intellectual activity. These rules (called akousmata or symbola) were, at least at first, based on oral teachings of the master; initiated members were called akousmatikoi and lived in tight-knit communities (which were apparently open to women as well as men). Among the most prominent rules was vegetarianism based on the doctrine of metempsychosis (that is, the transmigration of the immortal soul). Other rules emphasized ascetism, harmony, justice, and moral purity.\nBy the end of Pythagorasâ life, Pythagorean societies across Magna Graecia were subject to increasingly violent attacks, and around 450 BC Pythagorean power in Croton came to an end. The movement began to fray and was eventually split into two parts: the religious akousmatikoi who continued to follow Pythagorasâ oral teachings, and the scientific mathematikoi who chiefly pursued mathematical and cosmological learning. Many Pythagoreans became mendicants or migrated to other parts of the Greek world, whether in Italy or mainland Greece. Pythagorasâ teachings were thus widely disseminated. As a religious movement, the Pythagoreans seems to have had an abiding influence on several cults, especially that of the Orphics, with whom their doctrines coincided on several important points (especially vegetarianism and their belief in the immortality of the soul). Pythagorean thought also had an important influence on philosophers such as Philolaus in the late fifth century BC and Plato in the fourth century BC. In the first century BC, the Pythagorean movement was revived in Rome by Nigidius Figulus. Around the same time, the Platonist Eudorus in Alexandria attributed to the Pythagoreans a supreme One, and this monistic Platonism was soon developed by the so-called Neopythagoreans: Moderatus of Gades in the first century CE, Nicomachus of Gerasa and Numenius of Apamea in the second century CE. This movement eventually influenced the Neoplatonism of Plotinus in the third century CE. Porphyry and Iamblichus both wrote lives of Pythagoras, representing the founder of Pythagoreanism as a larger-than-life holy man and as the precursor to much of Platonic philosophy. Despite this enduring popularity of Pythagorean ideas, however, it is disputed whether religious Pythagoreanism survived in any meaningful way after the classical period. It was during this period that the Golden Words, a collection of life rules attributed to Pythagoras himself, surfaced in written form. And though pseudoepigraphical Pythagorean writings continued to be produced throughout the Hellenistic period, religious Pythagorean communities â always something of a fringe movement â would never regain the importance and popularity they had in the sixth and fifth centuries BC.",

    "description": "It is important to distinguish an official Elamite religion, which appears through the texts, archeological evidence and many other sources such as artwork, and the reality of the Elamite religious practices. As a multicultural kingdom in which many nomadic and settled people have mingled through time, Elam does not possess a monolithic pantheon and frozen rigorous beliefs, it has evolved a lot due to external influences from Mesopotamia, Luristan or even Egypt, and to internal policies established to unite the plains of Susa and the mountains of Anshan. \n\nThe lack of sources prevents researchers from knowing how the Elamite religion was really practiced by people and most of the knowledge relates to the state religion. Even if sacred texts were not found, a main pantheon was delineated with gods and goddesses associated with major symbols such as the underworld for Inshushinak or the sky for Napirisha for example. Other gods were added to this pantheon when nomadic tribes settled in Elam, like Adad, or when Mesopotamian people came to Elam bringing their own beliefs and practices. Thus, the Elamite religion as it is known currently is more of a state religion than a reality which most likely consisted in a patchwork of many influences with syncretistic beliefs. \n\nThe first mention of Elam in written sources comes from the Akkadian empire around 2600-2500 BCE and the very first god quoted is Simut, the herald god of Elam, in the name of a vice-king of Elam, Sanam-Simut, under the reign of Lukh-khisshan, king of Awan and contemporary of Sargon of Akkad. Then, some other striking examples of an Elamite state religion appear during the kingdomâs apogees : a statue of Narrundi under the reign of Puzur-Inshushinak around 2100 BCE (he was a king who tried to create Elamâs own language, currently known as paleo elamite, and who conquered the plains of Susa, taking it back from the Akkadians), the city of Dur-Untash built by Untash-Napirisha at the end of the 14th century BCE (it was a political attempt to unite Susa and Anshan together through a religious unification, bringing Napirisha and Inshushinak in the same temple, but it didnât last long) and finally the Shutrukide dynasty during the 12th century BC (which left many evidence of religious buildings and dedicated artworks like the Sit Shamshi). The end of the Elamite religion is as blurry as the end of the Elamite kingdom, as the Achaemenids had assimilated many practices from them and talked about Elamite gods in texts found at Persepolis, but it might have persisted a bit during and after the transition from a kingdom to another around 531 BCE.",

    "description": "Generally understood to emerge with the teachings of the Tamil Sri Lankan religious scholar Arumuga Navalar (1822-1879), Tamil neo-Saivism is a discrete, reformist strain of Saiva Siddhanta Hinduism that has had wide-reaching influence on Tamil Hindu religious life and modern Tamil cultural thought in the Tamil cultural regions of South India and northern Sri Lanka (i.e., Tamil Elam). Some key features of Tamil neo-Saiva thought and practice include a frequent theological and scholastic focus on autonomous, \"Dravidian\" Tamil cultural identity and history relative to Brahmanical, Sanskritic, \"Aryan\" Hinduism; an explicitly monotheistic theology centered on the Hindu god Siva (Tamil civaá¹, Sanskrit Åiva; spelled Siva in this entry in deference to English-language neo-Saiva spelling conventions); and a particular connection with the Vellala caste community, a non-Brahmin Tamil caste community especially culturally influential and prestigious in pre-colonial Tamil society. Key to the intellectual development of neo-Saivism was the efflorescence of Tamil literary and historical scholarship associated with the Tamil Renaissance of the closing decades of the 19th century. Vellala Neo-Saiva scholars were at the forefront of historical scholarship that sought to investigate the culture, history, and social norms of an indigenous, pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the \"rediscovery\" of a wide range of ancient Tamil literature in the latter half of the 19th century offered a rich body of evidence for both theological and scholastic arguments about Tamil cultural identity. In opposition to the Sanskritic Brahmanical Hindu tradition, which attained an unprecedented degree of political and social influence in the Tamil country under British colonial rule, Tamil neo-Saivism eschews Sanskrit-language religious literature and Vedantic theology, instead recognizing a canon of Tamil-language texts and hymns including classical Tamil poetic literature from the Sangam period, the Saivite Tamil bhakti poetry of the NÄyaá¹Är poet-saints (6th-8th CE), and a variety of Tamil-language tantric and agamic texts with ties to non-Brahmin Tamil temple worship practices. Reversing the claims of Brahmanical Hinduism, Tamil neo-Saivism asserts that the worship of Siva is native to pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the Brahmanical tradition is a subsequent corruption of originally Tamil religious teachings. A resulting priority in neo-Saiva theology and scholarship is the re-establishment of putatively original Tamil religious, social, and cultural mores, a project through which religious ideas became linked to a distinct cultural politics. Notable Tamil neo-Saiva luminaries include Somasundara Nayakar (1846-1901), P. Sundaram Pillai (1855-1897), Maraimalai Adigal (1876-1950), and Neelambikai Ammaiyar (1903-1945).",

    "description": "Ascetic practices had been rich and varied from the beginning of Christian history.  In the first few centuries CE, precedents were established for some of the ascetic practices and goals monasticism became known for, such as the existence of communities of ascetic practioners living according to common spiritual goals, and the movement from populated centers to the outskirts, for reasons that included (but were not limited to) seeking peaceful environments for spiritual contemplation.  Christianity became officially recognized as a legal religion under Constantine in the early fourth century, and this policy change allowed the freedom for new modes of Christian practice and social organization.\n\nIn late third- and early fourth-century Egypt, new forms of Christian ascetic practice arose in the forms of eremitic, semi-eremetic, and cenobitic monasticism.  Eremitic monasticism, engagement in a solitary lifestyle devoted to spiritual pursuits apart from society, gained notoriety with the wide circulation of the Life of Antony by Athanasius, the archbishop of Alexandria.  Over time, influenced by reports of Antony, who lived alone for years in increasingly remote and challenging locations, battling demons and attaining a rare level of spiritual transformation, thousands of people, following his example, moved into the desert.  The three areas described in this entry were major centers for this new semi-eremitic monastic way of life.  (Compare these forms of monasticism with cenobitic monasticism, a more fully communal lifestyle, as represented by Pachomian monasticism, which is described in detail in a separate DRH entry.)\n\nAmoun is credited for founding Nitria, about forty miles southeast of Alexandria (near modern al-Barnuji).  This site grew quickly to include not only monks seeking a spiritual life removed from society, but additionally, supportive visitors and other travelers who would stay in the area, with the result that over time, a tourist industry of sorts sprang up in the area.  This influx of visitors encroached on the monastic goal of a lifestyle of peaceful meditation, and some monks decided to move farther into the desert, into the area of Kellia (which means âthe cellsâ).  A story is told about Amoun and Antony determining the location of the new site within a dayâs walk of Nitria (about twelve miles away), far enough to achieve the remoteness desired, but close enough to facilitate visiting between the two communities (APalph Antony 34).  South of Nitria and Kellia is the area of Scetis, founded around 330 by Macarius of Egypt (so-called to distinguish him from Macarius of Alexandria) around a series of saline lakes (modern Wadi el Natrun).  All three locations are associated with niter/natron, a salt compound used in embalming, cleaning, and Egyptian faience.  These communities thrived and achieved wide renown as tales of their practices and inhabitants spread and inspired others across the Roman Empire during the fourth and fifth centuries.  Beginning in the early fifth century, a series of raids by desert nomads caused destruction to these communities, and initiated a slow decline.  Nitria was abandoned by the seventh century, and Kellia by the ninth.  Monastic activity waxed and waned over time in Scetis, with monastic activity still there in the present day.  The date range I cite for this entry (330-470 CE) is based on the estimated chronological limits for the primary evidence I am drawing from in answering the questions below.\n\nThe Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Fathers) preserves collections of sayings across multiple versions (notably the Alphabetical Collection [APalph], arranged by the name of the speaker named, the Systematic Collection [APsys], arranged roughly by topic, and the Anonymous Collection [APanon]), and in several languages.  (Note that because of this complicated source set, my AP citations below correspond to the numbering of commonly available English translations instead of critical editions, with the intention that a wider and more general readership can more easily track these down if interested.)  The sayings tend to follow the pattern of wisdom literature: short and pithy sayings intended to teach a moral lesson. Many come as responses to requests such as, âAbba, give me a word,â and âAbba, how can I be saved?â  Some are short dialogical narratives, often between a younger monk and a more experienced monk.  The majority (but not all) of these sayings are associated with residents of Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis, the last with the highest proportional representation.  These sayings were passed down and circulated through oral tradition and finally recorded probably in the late fifth century in Palestine.\n\nIn this entry, I am going to use the shorthand description âNitrian Desert communitiesâ to refer to Nitria, Kellia (with Pherme), and Scetis instead of listing them individually when I mean to refer to all of them.  This is not to say that there were not significant differences among people, practices, and social norms in these distinct areas; in fact, there were.  But rather, these can be grouped together meaningfully under one heading for two main reasons: 1) There is a recognizable monastic culture that is shared among these areas, partially because of the close social ties and visiting practices among them that fostered a coherent cultural and even social unity despite their geographical spread, and 2) the Apophthegmata Patrum, the largest single source (or more accurately, set of sources) of information about these communities, draws from their combined cultural group as a meaningful unit.",

    "description": "Perhaps, no other religious title and college has as long a tenure as the Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College, whose origins lay in the mythical foundations of Rome and continue today, albeit organizationally, religiously, and semantically different, in the Vatican within the Roman Catholic Church. The Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College has a debated origin. On the one hand, some scholars such Denova continue the traditional line that âPontifexâ means âthe bridge builderâ between man and the gods, and that the Pontifices were associated with the early river worship of the Tiberinus, and later Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Others such as Ribezzo and Kavanagh have argued that Pontifex comes from Sabine (Italic Oscan) and the word means âcollege of fiveâ (ponti < puntes âfiveâ and fex < trefex âcollegeâ). \nNevertheless, what is generally agreed upon is that the Pontifices served as advisors to the king of monarchical Rome. In Roman legends and ancient Roman historiography, King Numa (according to Livy) was one of the first Pontifex Maximus who established the organizational bureaucracy of the Roman state religion, the Vestal Virgins, and the appointment of other Pontifices. Whatever the reality of the situation was during the regal period of Rome, by the Middle of the Roman Republic, the Pontifices and their college began to have power over other priesthoods of Rome: the rex sacrorum, Vestal Virgins, the other flamines of other gods, the augurs, and, finally, the haruspices. Furthermore, the Pontifical College was in charge of the following activities: record keeping (annals, commentaries, etc.), the correct form of ritual and prayers, the Roman Calendar (âfastiâ), family law â patrician marriage, adoption, and the transference of dead bodies to other burial sites. Because the Pontifices were at the top of the Roman civic cult, additionally, they approved whether or not a new god could enter the Roman Pantheon (cases abound, such as Magna Mater and Quintus Metellus building a shrine to Isis -see the entry on Cult of Isis). \nTo highlight their importance, the offices of the Pontifical College were located in Regia and the living quarters of the Pontifex Maximus was in the domus publica, both of which are situated in the Roman forum â the civic center of Rome. Additionally, the Pontifical College was originally only reserved to the patrician class during the Early and Middle Republic, but by 300 BC, under the lex Ogulnia, the Pontifical College was open to the plebeians and the number of pontiffs increased to nine (RÃ¼pke). Furthermore, the Pontifex Maximus was subject to direct election of a selected number of Roman tribes (seventeen out of the thirty-five selected by lot - RÃ¼pke), and remained an appointment for life. The first plebeian Pontifex Maximus was, perhaps, Tiberius Coruncanius elected in 254 BC by the comitia and first published public consultations (Cornu-ThÃ©nard).\nOne last bureaucratic feature of the Pontifical Colleges was that Pontiffs could also become secular, legal magistrates and hold political office. Cases abound, and famous examples are the jurist Scaevola and Julius Caesar. Nevertheless, the Pontiffs were prohibited from holding other priesthoods, except for rare occasions (see Szelmer). Because a person could be both a pontiff and magistrate, it is quite clear that under the Roman Republic that the Pontifical College and the Senate worked closely in tandem. The Senate consulted the Pontifical College on omens, prodigies, and on what days could public and state business be held. At times, the position of pontiff could be used as political leverage, such as Julius Caesar who was elected as Pontifex before holding a single political office (Ross Taylor).\nOver time, however, the power of the Pontifical College and the Pontifex Maximus was diminished and became increasing subject to the violent political forces of the Late Republic. The dictator Sulla removed the Lex Domitia â the direct election of pontiffs by the comitia of the Roman people â and placed the election at the hands of the Pontifical College. This was undone later by the Lex Labiena, though Lily Ross finds that there was no change under Sulla and that Caesar solely supported the Lex Labiena to gain popular favor. Another restriction to the Pontificate was the Lex Papia that prohibited the Pontifical College from directly selecting a Vestal Virgin: instead, the Pontifex Maximus recommended names to be selected by lot at a public Roman contio (Mekacher and Van Haeperen).\nAt last, with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, the ensuing civil wars, and Augustusâ election in 12 BC as Pontifex Maximus (Cameron), did the unification of the Pontifex Maximus and secular power occur. As Emperor, Augustus expanded the power of the Pontifex Maximus over all religious colleges that were not subject to the purview of the Pontifical College (such as mystery cults) (Cameron), and enshrined the power of both Emperor and Pontifex Maximus in the Imperial cult. The Emperor as Pontifex Maximus continued long into 4th and 5th century, despite the advent of Christianity and the Christian appropriation of pontifices to name their bishops. Cameron points out that the bishop of Rome in the AD 360s was pontifex summus, and not maximus. Furthermore, Christian emperors did not shy away from the title of Pontifex Maximus, until, perhaps, the Emperor Gratian in AD 382, where inscriptions begin to state imperial nomenclature not as Pontifex Maximus, but as Pontifex Inclitus (Cameron). Whatever the case may be, the situation of Late Antiquity demonstrates the process in which Church hierarchy begins to shed off the influence of imperial power that will culminate in the investiture conflicts of the Middle Ages (Concordat of Worms) and the Renaissance.",

    "description": "âBeat Buddhismâ refers to the intermediary period of experimentation with Buddhism by members of the Beat Generation (1944-1960s), most notably Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder, that preceded the emergence of popular institutional forms of convert communities in the United States which maintained religious and secular spaces for practice, like temples or meditation centers. Rather, the location of a uniquely Beat praxis of Buddhism originates from a literary tradition of exploration into âOrientalâ religions and mysticism first made possible by the American Romantic lineages of Transcendentalism and Theosophy in the 19th century. Although wrought with colonial assumptions about Asia; Transcendentalist writers, like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, heavily influenced the Beatsâ idealistic reinterpretation and socially-informed deployment of Buddhism, which attracted the attention of mainstream American readers for the first time in the Fifties. \nThe Beat Generation from which the distinctly Romantic, Protestant, and subterranean nature of Beat Buddhism arises, represents a subcultural movement that marks a watershed moment in the advancement of postmodernism in post-World War II America. The central elements of the Beatâs countercultural movement included the rejection of a status-quo maintained by traditional Christian values, a rejection of economic materialism, and a rejection of the stratification of classes based on socio-economic conformity. Instead, they sought out alternative American and Asian spiritual traditions on a quest for sexual liberation and human transcendence. In their radical pursuit of âsatoriâ (sudden enlightenment), a sudden experience of reality unfettered by the illusory restraints of dualism that appeared on the American landscape in the form of inequitable social norms, Beat Buddhism extends the discourse of D.T. Suzuki and Alan Wattâs, who repackaged Japanese Zen for American audiences by emphasizing the pure experience of the emptiness, or nondualism, of reality through the practice of living spontaneously. \nDespite the non-institutional (or even anti-institutional) and transient foundation of Beat Buddhism as a religious interlocutor between the Orientalist exploration of Buddhism through the early-20th century, and the birth of convert communities in the United States; it contains several elements that can be identified as core beliefs and practices. First, Beat Buddhism is primarily concerned with the Four Noble Truths and how to overcome individual suffering within oneâs current life. For Beats like Kerouac, Buddhism provided an ontology that explained suffering as the result of social ignorance and unrest. Second, drawing from Suzuki and Watts, Beat Buddhism is emphatically centered on experiencing what Kerouac coined âthe golden eternityâ or emptiness as a means of escape. Beat Buddhists believed that by training oneself to perform spontaneous acts of artistic expression, especially through âstream of consciousnessâ prose and poetry, one could experience their true (non) selves, unadulterated by the social baggage of 1950âs America. \nThird, in a shortlist of main elements that characterize the Beatsâ mobilization of Buddhism, is their romanticism of the mendicant or ascetic lifestyle. Phrases like âZen-lunaticsâ and ârucksack revolution;â and hermit-like livelihoods requiring immersion with nature, like train-hopping, logging, sailing, and serving posts on fire lookouts, are idolized in the pages of Beat literature. Thus, Beat Buddhism, the quintessential form of American Buddhism from the Fifties and Sixties, maintains its lineage of textuality in which American Transcendentalism and Buddhism modernism intersect in a mutual clarion-call to rebel against the suffering caused by social conformism.",

    "description": "The personal Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei, usually just called Opus Dei  (\"Work of God\" in Latin), is a Roman Catholic, international institution which proclaims that lay people (i.e. non priests, monks, and nuns) can and ought to seek holiness in their ordinary life in the world. It was founded by St. Josemaria Escriva, a Spanish priest who lived from 1902-1975, and was declared a saint by the Catholic Church in 2002. According to St. Josemaria, on October 2, 1928, he saw by divine inspiration that God was asking him to spread the universal call to holiness, and that a new path would be opened up within the Church â Opus Dei â to spread this call throughout the world. Since its founding, Opus Dei has welcomed and spiritually motivated people of every racial, social, and secular condition. There are now around 90,000 members of Opus Dei, and its message has reached millions. \nOpus Dei is not a religious order of the Catholic church, nor is it a third order, i.e. an extension of a religious order made up of lay people attracted by the orderâs spirituality. Members of Opus Dei often draw a comparison between their lives and the lives of the early Christians. The early Christians lived out their baptismal call seriously, seeing work, family life, and the ordinary events of each day as opportunities for drawing close to Christ, and making him known to others. Externally they did nothing to distinguish themselves from their fellow citizens. Likewise, the members of Opus Dei are ordinary people. They work like everyone else and live in the midst of the world just as they did before they joined. This distinguishes Opus Dei from the religious orders of the Catholic Church. Nor did Opus Dei arise to bring a solution to the situation in a given country at a given time. Rather, it claims to possess a universal spirit for all times and all centuries.  Visibly and in fact, Opus Dei aims to form contemplatives in the middle of the world rather than outside of it. The ideal is to live Christianity in the context of earthly occupations. The patron of Opus Dei is St. Joseph, who combined prayer, ordinary work, and family and social life in a continuous symbiosis, making it impossible for these to be separated from one another.  \nWhile the spirituality of Opus Dei emphasizes the pursuit of holiness in work and the ordinary events of daily life, its foundation is an awareness of every human beingâs divine filiation, or identity as a child of God. Opus Dei seeks to foster among Christians a deep awareness of their being children of God, which includes confidence in divine providence, simplicity in their dialogue with God, a need for fraternity among all people and respect for human dignity, a truly Christian love for the world and all realities created by God, and a spirit of peace and cheerful hope. Other key features of Opus Deiâs spirituality are the importance of prayer and sacrifice, the value of personal freedom, charity towards others, and unity of life (i.e. the integration of oneâs interior and religious life with oneâs professional, social, and family life).",

    "description": "Churches of Christ in North America are a collection of autonomous Christian congregations that have their origins in the \"Restoration Movement\" within American Christianity that occurred in the 1800's. Located primarily in the American south, Churches of Christ emerged in the first major division of the Stone-Campbell Movement at the end of the nineteenth century. This separation was made complete in 1906, when the United States Bureau of the Census distinguished Churches of Christ as a separate and distinct religious group. There are currently more than 13,000 individual congregations within the United States with an average membership of 100 people. Of those 13,000 congregations, 1,240 of them have a predominately African American membership (approximately 172,000 members). Churches of Christ also has an additional 240 congregations that are independent Spanish-speaking churches, most of which are located in Texas, California, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe majority of members of Churches of Christ in the United States live in the central and southern regions of the country. While there are Church of Christ congregations in every state, they are most heavily concentrated in the American south, from Texas to North Carolina. More than 28 percent of members of Churches of Christ live in either Texas or Tennessee. Churches of Christ began from a motivation not to start a new form of Christianity, but to serve as a unifying movement that sought to bring together previously divided Christians through an appeal to the pattern of Christianity as interpreted in the New Testament. \n\nFollowing from this appeal to a return to the form of Christianity present within the New Testament, Churches of Christ have rejected any formal organizational structures, choosing instead to have the local congregation serve as its own governing authority. This has also meant that Churches of Christ have no official journals or other processes by which to declare sanctioned positions. Because of the independent nature of Churches of Christ, commonalities across the tradition depend more on a specific set of practices and interpretive strategies than declared theological convictions or beliefs.\n\nWhile changing within some parts of the tradition, Churches of Christ is most well-known for its practice of acapella singing. Yet there are other distinctive features that have marked this denomination as a distinctive group among other Christian traditions. First among these distinctive features is the hermeneutical approach that has been at the core of Church of Christ identity and practice since its inception. This interpretive approach rests on a three-fold pattern that reads Scripture and shapes its communal and individual practice by finding in Scripture a direct command, an example to imitate, or by making a necessary inference when commands or examples are not present. This interpretive approach has been highly influential within Churches of Christ, and is the source of many contemporary debates and the appropriate response. Second, Churches of Christ are defined by a strong commitment to notions of the priesthood of all believers, and therefore eschew any distinction between a âreligiousâ and ânon-religiousâ class. There is no ordination process within Churches of Christ. And while religious training (either through a theological school or some other form) is viewed as a positive thing, none is required to serve in a ministerial role within the tradition. Rather, worship and communal life within Churches of Christ is dependent upon a high level of involvement by the members of each congregation. Finally, Churches of Christ have, historically, possessed a high level of exclusivism in its understanding of its religious identity. While this characteristic has come under fire and is changing within many parts of the tradition, it has been a defining feature for much of the traditionâs history.\n\nAs it moves into the 21st century, Churches of Christ are currently facing a number of questions and challenges, ranging from questions of gender and sexuality inclusion, to the trends of religious decline that are effecting all religious traditions within the United States.",

    "description": "The Parsis (or Parsees) are an ethno-religious community traditionally based in western India, and professing the Zoroastrian religion. They are the descendants of the group of Zoroastrians who migrated to India after the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century CE. The Parsis of India constitute the largest community of followers of Zoroastrianism in the world. Over the centuries, the Parsis have integrated into Indian society, while simultaneously maintaining their distinct religious customs and ethnic identity. The term PÄrsi (meaning âPersianâ in the Persian language) is used as a descriptor of the community signifying their Iranian origin.\nThe early history of the Parsis in India is not known well, and mainly traced to a single source, the Qisse-ye SanjÄn âThe Story of SanjÄnâ dated to 1600 CE. After initially settling in and around the town of SanjÄn in South Gujarat on the west coast of India, they are supposed to have dispersed northwards to other towns in Gujarat, mainly Navsari, Ankleshwar, Bharuch and Khambat (Cambay).\nHowever the period from the 17th century onward is relatively well recorded, and after the arrival of the British in India, the Parsis transformed from a predominantly rural agricultural community to one engaged in many services and industrial pursuits, especially in the cities of Surat and Bombay. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the community rapidly rising to prominence, and under British patronage, were pioneers in many fields including education and the arts. Many prominent families amassed large fortunes and the community became well-known for its munificent charities. In the 20th century, the Parsis dispersed across the Indian sub-continent as well as to other British colonies such as Aden and East African countries.\nThe Parsis today are a highly urbanised community with more than 95% of its members living in cities, chiefly Mumbai (formerly Bombay) which has been home to 70% of the Indian Parsis since the 1950s. The last fifty years have seen many Parsis, especially the youth, emigrating to other countries, mainly UK, USA and Canada, the Middle-east and more recently to Australia and New Zealand.  \n\nClass: Among the Parsis, the priestly class (Athornans) is differentiated from the laity (Behdins), and the priesthood is hereditary. Only boys belonging to the priestly class are eligible to undergo the initiation ceremonies of priesthood. \nLanguage: Since the Parsis were based in the Indian state of Gujarat for much of their long history, their native language is Gujarati; however their dialect, Parsi Gujarati, is distinct from the standard Gujarati of the state. While almost all Parsis can converse in Gujarati, the youth especially in urban areas increasingly use English as their primary language for communication. The religious texts of the Parsis are mainly in Avestan, an Old Iranian language, and also in Pahlavi (Middle Persian). Though both these languages are not comprehended by a majority of the Parsis, all prayers are still recited in these languages as per tradition by both the priesthood and the laity.\nSects: The Parsis are differentiated from their fellow Zoroastrians who arrived from Iran to India in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are known as the Iranis. The term Parsi-Irani is used as a designator for the entire Zoroastrian community of India, however the standalone term Parsis is also used interchangeably as an all-encompassing term. \nThe community is also divided on the basis of a calendrical difference into two factions, the majority Shahenshahis (âRoyalistsâ) who continued to follow the existing calendar of the Indian Zoroastrians, and the minority Kadimis (âAncientsâ) who adopted the old calendar of the Iranian Zoroastrians, which runs one month ahead of the Shahenshahi calendar.",

    "description": "Theurgy in late antiquity combined Platonic philosophy with the indigenous ritual practices of the Roman Empire (sacrifice, divination, etc.). Although theurgy first appeared in the so-called Chaldean Oracles of the second century CE, the most important surviving statement of theurgic theory and practice is the treatise \"On the Mysteries\" (De mysteriis) of the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus (c. 240 â c. 325 CE). Scholars generally understand Neoplatonism beginning with Iamblichus to represent a break with the earlier thought of Plotinus (205 â 270 CE) due to its reliance on ritual as a means of salvation for the soul. After Iamblichus, the most important expositor of theurgic Neoplatonism was Proclus (412 â 485 CE), whose ideas directly influenced the Christian liturgy of pseudo-Dionysius. The word theurgy combines two Greek roots, theos (god) and ourgos (work). As \"divine work,\" theurgy is understood to be a cooperative endeavor between the gods and human beings, in which the latter use divinely inspired ritual to increase their fitness for divine influence. Informed by centuries of Platonic thinking about individual and cosmic bodies, theurgy maps the parts of the self (microcosm) onto the parts of the universe (macrocosm), allowing one to enact rituals in order to purify or empower the parts of the self through an understanding of cosmic sympathy. Theurgic ritual, according to Iamblichus and Proclus, interacts with the various parts of the highly stratified divine cosmos, which is itself envisioned (following Platoâs Timaeus 30d-31a) as a single living being encompassing all other beings. The metaphor of a living cosmos provides the basis for the doctrine of cosmic sympathy (sumpatheia) and its transcendent cause, divine love (theia philia), which provides cohesion for the universe (macrocosm) as well as for the individual soul (microcosm). The sympathy between the soul, the universe, and the gods allows the theurgist to employ \"signatures\" (sumbola, sunthÄmata) consisting of natural materials (e.g. stones, plants, incense), divine names, and mental constructs in order to achieve his or her goals. The goals of theurgy are consistent with those of Platonic philosophy â becoming like god (á½Î¼Î¿Î¯ÏÏÎ¹Ï Î¸Îµá¿·: Platoâs Theaetetus 176b) â as a lifelong practice producing a \"cumulative contact, assimilation, and, ultimately, union with the divine and thereby the divinization of the theurgist\" (Addey 2014: 25). A cosmic hierarchy of beings, thought forms, and ritual objects informed this lifelong practice and may have made theurgy difficult to distinguish from magic for the casual observer. In fact, the principles of theurgic ritual were very close to Plotinusâs account of how magic (mageia, goÄteia) functioned through cosmic sympathy (Ennead 4.4.40). However, theurgy was distinct from ancient magic in at least two ways: (1) The aims of theurgy were different. Whereas magicians might think to coerce the gods for their own worldly ends, theurgists (and all Platonists) understood the gods to be immutable, so they instead focused on enhancing their own fitness for assimilating divine power, which was a gift from the gods. (2) Although cosmic sympathy in its popular form may have functioned \"horizontally\" in the material world only, for theurgists sympathy as an expression of divine love (theia philia) always had a vertical component: objects in the material world derived their potency from divine powers by corresponding to a certain \"chain\" (seira) of influence, such as a planet or another astrological category.",

    "description": "The Victorines refer to the individuals, thought and practices associated with the Catholic abbey of St Victor. Established by William of Champeaux (1070 â 1121) in 1108, just outside Paris on the left bank of the Seine, the abbey of St. Victor was founded as a refuge for contemplation and teaching, surviving until its dissolution during the French Revolution. This focus on teaching made St Victor part-abbey, part-school, accepting adult male novices aged 15 or over. St Victor rose to prominence in the first and second quarters of the twelfth century under a series of talented abbots and teachers, becoming a renowned centre for theological and philosophical innovation. The exhortation to âlearn everythingâ (omnia disce) issued by the orderâs most famous master, Hugh of St Victor (c. 1096 â 1141), served aptly as the statement of the institutionâs methodology and purpose. Poetry, metaphysics, history, biblical exegesis, humanism, trinitarian theology, contemplation and mysticism were all practiced within the abbeyâs walls. What united members of the school of St Victor was the belief that the categorisation, systematisation and harmonisation of theology and philosophy possessed the salvific purpose of restoring man to the âimage and likenessâ of God. \n\nDenominationally, the abbey of St Victor belonged to the religious â as opposed to secular â branch of canons (regular canons) who lived communally, were attached to a church, and followed a particularly strict interpretation of the Rule of St Augustine for instruction. Like other twelfth-century Augustinian groups of regular canons, for example, the Premonstratensians, the identity of the Victorines and their ethos of reform was shaped by the Gregorian Reform movement from the mid-eleventh century that had reorganised the clergy and re-emphasised their commitment to poverty and teaching. What differentiated the Victorines from other groups of canons regular were its royal connections, the stress of a life of philosophical virtue and its specific blend of love and friendship â a trait shared with monastic orders of the day. However, in contrast to Benedictine, Cistercian and Augustinian monks, the Victorines occupied a liminal position as a âquasi monasticâ organisation. While monastic traits such as hierarchical system of titles, a central legislative body and a rule of silence were observed, the Victorines avoided a system of unequal mother-daughter house filiations like the Cistercians, equally emphasised theological and philosophical knowledge, and their geographical position close to the city ensured that they retained a distinctive balance between the active and contemplative modes of life.",

    "description": "Calvinism, in its early stages, drew its character and theological emphases from the ministry and teaching of John Calvin. Born in France, Calvin moved to Geneva in 1534 and, after a brief exile (1538-41), he returned and was installed as the religious leader of the new republic. Calvin was influenced by other early ReformersâMartin Luther, Huylrich Zwingli, Philip Melancthon, and Heinrich Bullingerâand adopted the theological touchstones of the movement: scripture alone, faith alone, grace alone, Christ alone, and glory to God alone. While early Calvinism continued to affirm much of the Christian tradition, Calvin was instrumental in forming his own distinct form of Protestantism. Theologically, early Calvinism distinguished itself from Roman Catholicism in its understanding of the authority of scripture, the person and work of Jesus Christ (Christology), the emphasis on Godâs election (predestination), the sacraments, and on the purpose and shape of the Christian life. In terms of the latter, Calvin uniquely combined the ecclesiastical structures of the church in Geneva with the local governing structures, effectively combining his theological commitments about the transformation of the human being by the grace of God in faith with their social and ethical expressions. His understanding of the way the Church could and should regulate the moral lives of citizens, as well as church members, was rooted in an expectation that this was how societies, nations, and eventually the world, would be transformed. While later Calvinism is associated with a number of different ecclesiastical forms and cannot be said to agree on any one set of theological doctrines, early Calvinism was very much tied to the person of John Calvin and the local way he applied his theology, ecclesiastically and politically, in Geneva. Where applicable, it will include the work of his contemporaries in the Reformation moments (i.e., Zwingli in Switzerland, Luther in Germany)",

    "description": "Across the large geographical space of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas, cultures and societies of speakers of Tibetic languages share certain religious notions and similar ritual practices which do not derive from Buddhism or Yungdrung BÃ¶n (g.Yung drung Bon) but rather relate to local natural environments and social structures. Being very variable and difficult to subsume under one term, these localised religious cults have been called âpopularâ (Bell 1931), ânamelessâ (Stein 1972), âfolkâ (Tucci 1980), often also âshamanismâ or âbÃ¶nâ (bon), and in specific cases âpaganâ (Ramble 2008) and âmundaneâ. They are concerned with mundane aims of well-being and prosperity, fecundity and progeniture, health, protection and warfare, and general worldly success; not with soteriology. They most likely represent indigenous, pre-Buddhist cults of Tibet and the Himalayas.\n\nCosmologically, the world is threefold, composed from (1.) the upper heavenly sphere of deities (lha / lha); (2.) the middle earthly level inhabited by humans and other, including supernatural, beings (for ex. nyen / gnyan, tsen / btsan, dÃ¼ / bdud, etc.), usually rendered into English as gods, deities, spirits, demons, etc.; and (3.) the lower chthonic realm of various other beings (widely called lu / klu). Humans in the intermediate level come into contact with beings, more or less powerful, benevolent or malicious, from all the three permeable spheres, and must develop methods of communication and coexistence with them in order to live and prosper. These typically consist of prescribed behavior and taboos, invocations, offerings and other ritual means, by which people acquire forces of good fortune, prosperity and fertility, and avoid possible punishments. These beings are often anthropomorphic and perceived to dwell in the sky (or elaborated atmospheric levels) or in physical structures, both natural and man-made: mountains, hills, rocks, boulders, water sources, plants; hearth, the main house pillar; and also in the human body. As they can be in fact omni-present, they often influence peopleâs lived daily realities and practices. Probably thousands of such deities exist, at times organised into hierarchised groups. \n\nTerritorial deities, commonly called yÃ¼llha (yul lha, âgod of a valley/regionâ), zhidak (gzhi bdag, âlord of a base/place/soilâ), yÃ¼llha zhidak (yul lha gzhi bdag), or yÃ¼lsa (yul sa, âlord of earth/placeâ), tend to be the most prominent, and among them mountain deities believed to inhabit mountain glaciers and peaks and govern their surroundings. Mountain deities, and certain deities of the celestial realm, are sometimes perceived as ancestors of descent lines and whole communities, usually tied to patrilines and oneâs birth place. Mountains and their deities have become important symbols of regional and, especially since the mid-20th century, also Tibetan national identity, such as Mt Kailash, Gang TisÃ© (Gangs ti se) or Gang Rinpoche (Gangs rin po che) in Tibetan, in West Tibet, and AnyÃ© Machen (A myes rma chen) in East Tibet. The paramount Mt Everest is also sacred and hosts goddess Jomo Langma (Jo mo glang ma). Almost all local cults have been historically exposed to Buddhist and Yungdrung BÃ¶n domination, and in most cases were to varying degrees incorporated into the two Doctrines. Vice versa, they have influenced all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including Yungdrung BÃ¶n, by bringing strong local elements into even common monastic practice. Many local cults are very vulnerable also to current globalising and modernisation pressures.",

    "description": "The Samaritans are a religious group in the Abrahamic Tradition that originated in northern Israel. The group, which exists to the present day, traces its origins to ancient Israel and holds that their southern neighbors split off from them during the time of Eli. Ancient Samaritans worshiped the God of Israel and claimed that they, not the Jews, preserved the correct practices for worship. The separation between the two groups was gradual but would likely have been established by the time of (or as a result of) Hyrcanusâ destruction of the temple at Mt. Gerizim in the 2nd century BCE. \nThe primary religious text of the Samaritans is called the Samaritan Pentateuch, or the Samaritan Torah, which contains the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Traditionally, Samaritans regard the Pentateuch as the only authoritative biblical books. Although most of the differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Jewish Torah are largely technical, the Samaritan Pentateuch includes several substantive differences, most of which are related to their claim that Mt. Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the appropriate place for worshiping the God of Israel. \nThe major sources on early Samaritans include Josephus, the New Testament, and Rabbinic Literature, although references to the Samaritans have also been suggested in works such as Ezra, Nehemiah, and Ben Sira. In addition to literary sources, much recent work in archaeology has provided further information about the ancient Samaritans.",

    "description": "The rise of the exclusive practice of the chanted nenbutsu (Jpn. senju nenbutsu) was integral to the development of Buddhism in medieval Japan. It involves exclusively practicing single-minded invocation of the Buddha AmitÄbha (Amida)âs name with six characters, âNa-mu A-mi-da butsuââliterally meaning âHomage to Amida Buddhaââ, by which to achieve salvation, birth in his Pure Land after oneâs death. The teaching of the exclusive nenbutsu represents a major intellectual trend in medieval Japanese Buddhism, where liberation from saá¹sÄric rebirth was often thought to depend on a single practice or condition. The doctrinal root of the teaching lies in the thought of a Japanese Buddhist thinker HÅnen-bÅ GenkÅ« (1133-1212). In the late twelfth century, HÅnen developed the radical claim that in the time when the Buddhist path is leading to its extinction, the entirety of this path should be encapsulated in a single practice of the chanted nenbutsu, through which he thought all sentient being will achieve birth in Amidaâs Pure Land after death. While the chanted nenbutsu had been traditionally construed as one of least essential practices suitable only to those of lesser religious capacity, HÅnen claimed its centrality in the Buddhist path, because he conceived it as a sole practice that Amida found corresponding to his original vow to save all sentient beings. According to him, Amidaâs selection of the chanted nenbutsu from multiple practices rendered all sentient beings equally benighted and thus urged them to rely completely on the other power of Amidaâs original vow that already guaranteed salvation. This claim led HÅnen to even insist that all other practices that require self-reliant efforts are to be totally abandoned. HÅnenâs teaching was further developed by one of his disciples Shinran (1173-1262), who gave a clearer expression to the absolute other power of Amida Buddha. These two thinkers, HÅnen and Shinran, were later regarded as the founders of two prominent Pure Land Buddhist schools, Pure Land school (JÅdo shÅ«) and True Pure Land school (JÅdo ShinshÅ«) respectively. They promoted the exclusive nenbutsu to address primarily the soteriological equality. However, as their followers proselytized the teaching from the late twelfth century, it did entail social implications for considering whether even those persons who violate religious and social norms could attain salvation. The teaching was thus of great appeal to those deemed as the hard-to-save in medieval society. Among them were included warriors, whose profession was taking lives, and women, who was regarded as with heavy karmic hindrances. The exclusive nenbutsu, however, also entailed an openness to the antinomian impulse, serving to legitimize zealous followersâ excessive acts, such as licensed evil and intentional violation the precepts. This invited severe criticism of HÅnen, Shinran, and their followers from the religious authority of the time and urged the authority to engage in suppressions of the followersâ groups.",

    "description": "As a part of the universal Catholic Church, Indonesian Catholicism features all of the rites, scripture, hierarchy present in Roman Catholicism. As anywhere, however, this world religion is expressed, understood, and practiced in accordance with the unique cultural history of Indonesia. Initially arriving with Portuguese traders in the early sixteenth century, Indonesian Catholicism has grown and flourished, becoming a powerful religious and political contender in the country and beyond. Demonstrating significant diversity across the archipelago, Indonesian Catholicism often integrates itself with local traditions and accommodates itself to the needs of different peoples.\n\nCatholics have played important roles in Indonesian history, contributing greatly to the national character and vision. In the nationâs early days, Catholic politicians and religious figures opposed the movement to require adherence to Islam, advocating instead for religious freedom. The effects of these debates can be seen in Indonesiaâs current policy of monotheism that recognizes six âofficialâ religions. One of Indonesiaâs principle newspapers, Kompas, was begun by Catholics in the1960s to offer an alternative to the media and perspectives of the Communist Party at the time. Today Kompas is a secular newspaper.  As in many parts of the world, Catholic schools and hospitals have often provided excellent education and healthcare, especially in remote regions that the state initially had trouble reaching, in this country of over 17,000 islands. \n\nDemographically, Catholics make up only a small minority of Indonesiaâs population: 2.91% according to the 2010 census, or about 7 million individuals. Of the 33 provinces existing during this census (room was made for a 34th in 2012), the provinces with the greatest number of Catholics were East Nusa Tenggara (54.14%), West Kalimantan (22.94%), and Papua (17.67%). East Nusa Tenggara is the only region where Catholics comprise a greater percentage of the population than any other religious group. Across Indonesia, 65% of Catholics live in the countryside, while the remaining 35% live in cities. Papua, West Papua, and East Nusa Tenggara are the poorest provinces in Indonesia (According to 2019-2020 data). \n\nThe demographic distribution of religion in Indonesia, together with a lively culture of internal mobility and migration, means that certain ethnic groups have become associated in-country with Catholicism. Prominent among these are the Batak of Sumatra, some Dayak groups from Kalimantan, and some Chinese-Indonesians. Perhaps most well-known for their Catholic history and culture are the Florenese, whose yearly processions draw thousands of pilgrims from around the country. While members of these groups have gained recognition as propagating Catholicism in Indonesia, Catholics can be found across the country, of many different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Throughout itâs rich history, Indonesian Catholicism has contributed important ideas, values, and expressions both to the country of Indonesia and the global Catholic Church, strengthening the diversity of each.",

    "description": "The Chishtis are a Sufi order of immense influence in South Asia, founded in Chisht, Afghanistan, in the tenth century and brought to South Asia in the late twelfth century AD. It is considered the oldest of the Sufi orders operating in the region, and has enjoyed patronage from rulers and politicians throughout its history. Divided into sub-branches, the Chishti order is still influential today. \n\nThe order quickly spread across South Asia even before Delhiâs political ascendancy, with early lodges (khanqahs) acting as sites of influence in Bengal, Gujarat, Malwa and the Deccan. Scholars have noted that such expansion indicates how the order was able to assimilate to social life in these areas; it is likely that for early adherents, Islam was synonymous with the teachings of the local Chishti shaykhs. This focus on adapting to local conditions has also been cited as a reason for their historically close relationship to local rulers and nobility. \n\nIn the eighteenth century, the majority-Muslim qasbah towns of the Upper Doab emerged as sites of Chishti influence.\n\nIn Chishti sacred geography, the city of Delhi is especially significant. The shrine of Shaykh Nizamuddin Auliya (d. 1325) is an important site of pilgrimage: each year, the six-day urs ceremony held on the anniversary of Nizamuddin Auliyaâs death attracts 150,000 people from across the country. Rulers based in Delhi helped to consolidate the shrineâs importance. Another important pilgrimage site is in Ajmer, Rajasthan, the burial place of Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236). Emperor Akbar relocated the Mughal capital to the village of Fatehpur Sikri to be next to the site of shaykh Salim Chishtiâs (d. 1572) khanqah. \n\nThough the shrines were always popular, membership in the Chishti order was associated with elites in Mughal times. From the late seventeenth century on, initiation into multiple Sufi orders became more common among prominent Muslim intellectuals, and many Muslim reformers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries belonged to several orders. While pilgrimage and participation in festivals at shrines is widespread among South Asian Muslims (and some Hindus), formal membership in the order is now largely hereditary, as each Chishti shrine is maintained by a familial lineage of âsajjada nasheenâ or spiritual heads of the shrine, who wield power and influence as beneficiaries of donations made to the shrine and managers of its calendar of festivals.\n\nWithin the landscape of South Asian Sufi groups, the Chishtis are predominant. They are known for the importance of music in their religious gatherings: Chishtis are credited with the invention of qawwali music, a South Asian devotional genre which is sung on Thursday nights at many shrines and during the annual âursâ festivals which commemorate the saintâs union with God upon their death. The Chishti order has historically been associated with what has been called a âsyncreticâ culture in South Asia, merging elements from Hindu society in their devotional practices, for example in the rituals surrounding the tomb of the shaykh. \n\nThe order defines itself based on a chain of authority (Silsila, meaning dynasty or literally âchainâ) that links its spiritual leaders (shaykhs) to each other all the way back to the Prophet. Consequently, there are several sub-sects established at breaking points in this list of shaykhs, called a âshajraâ, though these are not theologically distinct. In South Asia, the two main branches are the Chishti-Sabri (after âAlÄ-ud-dÄ«n âAlÄ« SÄbir, d. c. 1291) and the Chishti-Nizami (named for Nizamuddin Auliya, d. 1325).",

    "description": "The Mising community identifies as tribal and indigenous to Assam with migratory connections to the adjacent state of Arunachal Pradesh, in the northeastern region of India. They find definitive mentions in written sources, such as the Ahom Buranjis of the Ahom kingdom in Assam, from approximately 12th-15th centuries AD. They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe but are attempting to get 6th Schedule status. The 6th Schedule is a Government of India legislation that provides tribal autonomy in judicio-administrative proceedings of areas designated as Scheduled Areas. \n\nThe community speaks Mising, a Tibeto-Burman language which is seen by several scholars to mark its migratory connection with the Sino-Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman region. They also speak Assamese. \n\nThe Mising inhabit the Brahmaputra river valley along its northern bank covering several districts. This particular entry covers the Mising community living in small river islands known as the char region in Lakhimpur District, Assam. Surrounded by the Subansiri tributary of the River Brahmaputra, the chars are erosional spaces, some of which are submerged with the lashing of the floods each monsoon in the months of June and July. This char region is physically removed from areas across the river and require travel by ferries. \n\nThe religion ascribed to by respondents from the river island area is understood as a mixture of Mising religious practices that focus on nature worship and Hinduism, specifically Vaishnavite Hindu practices. There is mention of the Vaishnava tradition being the first indicator of a conversion to Hinduism due to the popularity of the same in the region.  The Neo-Vaishnavite movement in Assam which is linked to spiritual leader Srimanta Sankardeva around15th century CE is often proclaimed as a socially 'integrative' and 'assimilative' force which saw tribal communities such as the Mising converting to Vaishnavism. \n\nThe community continues to practice nature worship through several rituals honoring Donyi and Polo, referring to the sun and moon respectively.  Among other forces worshipped are asu(water), among(earth), asar(wind).\n \nIn 2019, there was seen to be a push amongst certain river island communities towards an increased emphasis on Donyi-Polo worship. That year, the BJP government won several tribal council elections and built alliances with Mising political parties.",

    "description": "Pentecostal and Charismatic practices of speaking in tongues through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit had become accepted within many mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church by the 1960s and 1970s. However, many evangelical traditions and churches continued to resist charismatic renewal practices and theologies during the rise of the Second Wave Charismatic Renewal Movement. Charismatics were viewed with suspicion and their practices were critiqued and mocked within evangelical circles.  \n\nYet, evangelicalism was not immune to change during the 1960s and 1970s. The hippie-led Jesus People Movement took hold in the United States during this time. Young barefoot preachers would encourage their peers to turn away from drugs, accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and join a new type of church that emphasized a come-as-you-are vibe with casual dress and provided rock and roll as part of their worship liturgy. In addition, many of the new hippie converts were interested in Charismatic practices of healing and witnessing through signs and wonders. The Jesus People Movement led to the formation of new independent evangelical churches that identified as non-denominational and some of these churches embraced Charismatic theology and practices.\n\nOne of the church movements that emerged in the late 1970s was the Vineyard Church in Southern California. The Vineyard was a collection of churches that broke away from Calvary Chapel due to the Vineyardâs desire to emphasize Charismatic practices and theology. On Motherâs Day in 1980, Pastor John Wimber of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Orange County, CA and invited a former Calvary Chapel pastor and the face of the Jesus People Movement, Lonnie Frisbee, to preach. Frisbeeâs message on healing and the subsequent ministry of healing that took place that morning launched the start of the Vineyard Movement and subsequent Neo-Charismatic movement. This new Neo-Charismatic movement blended evangelical theology with charismatic practices of healing, supernatural prayer languages, and an emphasis on miraculous signs and wonders as a component of evangelism. \n\nJohn Wimber began to teach at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA and was influenced by C. Peter Wagnerâs research on church growth as well as George Laddâs Kingdom of God theology. Wimber was able to influence numerous people to start their own independent charismatic churches and ministries as a faculty member and through his conferences that he hosted where he taught on how to minister using supernatural signs and wonder. Wimber developed the concept of âpower evangelismâ where adherents evangelized using signs and wonders rather than Bible tracts that were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  \n\nBy the 1990s, new independent churches and movements that were evangelical and charismatic were rapidly emerging throughout North America. These included the Toronto Blessing Movement began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church. Bethel Church in Redding, CA installed Pastor Bill Johnson as their senior pastor in 1996. The International House of Prayer Kansas City was founded in 1999. These Neo-Charismatic churches and others have become popular and controversial for their encouragement of the miraculous, their non-formal style of liturgy, and theological stances on healing, anointing, and supernatural power.\n\nC. Peter Wagner coined the term âThird Waveâ charismatic movement to describe these new churches and ministries. Their emphasis on power evangelism, charismatic forms of worship, healing, prayer languages, operating in signs and wonders, and their emphasis on anointing leaders as apostles and prophets made them distinct from traditional Pentecostal churches and Charismatic Renewalists within mainline traditions.",

    "description": "The empire of Nicaea existed from 1204 to 1261. Following the capture of Constantinople (modern Istanbul), many elites and the patriarch of the capital city moved to nearby Nicaea (modern Iznik), and this arrangement continued until 1261 when Constantinople fell to Michael VIII. Though predominantly (even almost exclusively) a Greek speaking, Chalcedonian Christian polity, it sat at the crossroads of polities comprised largely of Slavic Chalcedonian Christians, Roman Chalcedonian Christians, and Sunni Muslims. The mass movement of ecclesiastical hierarchy ensured, on the one hand, a general continuation of religious practice as it stood prior to the move, but led, on the other, to the development of new saintsâ cults and religious festivals. \nBy the 1220s, the political capital had moved largely to Nymphaion, almost 400 km from Nicaea, where the patriarch and the religious authorities remained. There remained, nevertheless, close ties, even with somewhat increased independence. The Greek patriarch, in exile from the traditional see in Constantinople, found a home in various monasteries and churches in Nicaea, while still maintaining a strong claim to the Constantinopolitan throne. A kind of intellectual bifurcation arose: they were on the one hand banished from their home, while on the other, they had found a safe, and quasi-paradisiacal, refuge. \nThe disruptive time from 1204 to 1261 does not seem to have produced any major discontinuities from a previous or later period, but perhaps new, and sometimes contradictory, emphases. Anti-Latin polemics, which had been present for centuries, heightened, but efforts towards union with the Roman church continued under the guidance of several emperors and patriarchs. There seemed to be a common vacillation between anti-papal and functionally pro-papal stances. The Roman state had long seen itself as a new Israel, and now the language of Israel in exile continued. Penalties against Jews, however, did not subside and indeed increased. Although occasional alliances with the Seljuks occurred and emperors sought the support of Seljuk leaders, a more favorable stance towards Islam does not seem to have arisen. \nNew devotions appeared and certain old devotions increased. St Tryphon became a dynastic, and his feast became a major celebration during the time in Nicaea, which seems to cool after the return to Constantinople. Devotions to St John the Theologian and the Theotokos, long present in Roman society, increase and persist after the move from Nicaea. The devotion to the Theotokos may be seen even on seals and coins.",

    "description": "The Indian state of Jharkhand is the homeland of 32 Scheduled Tribes (ST) and eight particularly vulnerable tribal groups.  According to the 2011 census, about four million Jharkhand residents are ST and the Oraon, who follow the Sarna religion, are about million. They are counted as \"other religions and persuasions\". The Sarna religion is based on animism and is sometimes called Addi Dharam.  They believe in a benevolent spirit and reply upon it for their overall wellbeing. The term 'Sarna' refers to a Sacred Grove or place of worship (which is usually a  Sal tree of the Shorea robusta species). The sacred grove is a small patch of forest that is protected because it is sacred and the site of deity worship. 'Spirits of the forest' are said to dwell in the roots of Sal trees, and 'spirits of the village' are said to reside in the most ancient of the Sal trees of the Sarna, or sacred grove of the village.  The tribal version of Sarna when we consider this linguistically offers a very pertinent explanation of the term Sarna. In Kurukh (Oraon language) there is a term called ''Saara Baana'' which means 'work to be accomplished'. In such a way, the place where all the wishes and works are accomplished is called Sarna. Controlling these events are different types of spirits: ancestral spirits, spirits of people who died unnaturally, or forest spirits. The sacred place is home to the deity Sarna Mai. Furthermore, peopleâs activities are based around propitiating, through blood sacrifice, spirits that happen to reside in nature. The Mundas and the Santals go to Sarna/Jaher for most of their religious rites, but Oraons go to Sarna only once a year. This yearly visit is for Khaddi, or the Sarhul feast, and the remaining have their own specific places of worship. The highest divinity or Supreme being, the creator of the Universe recognized by the Sarna Oraon is Dharmes. He fosters all living and non-living things. They believe that spirits control all the goods and the ills of life, like earthquakes, cyclones, and floods.  Second in the hierarchy are the spirits of naturally dead ancestors, called Pachbalar. Later sections belong to the village deities and spirits (Bansakti, Banjaribhut, Chatur-Siman-Garhadhora, Tusa-bhura). The fourth section are the spirits of hunting and war, called Chandi, worshipped by men; and spirits which protect pregnant women from the evil eye, called Joda and Achrael, worshipped only by women. The religion is organized around many tribal groups throughout Chattishgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and West Bengal.",

    "description": "Nestorian Christianity as a distinguished Christian group came into existence after the Christological movement that held the theological position initially developed by Nestorius (4/5 CE). Nestorius considered Christ the Son of God and Christ the son of Mary as two separate persons with two natures rather than one person having human and divine nature. That Christological teaching was officially condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 431. The Council of Ephesus anathema led to the separation of the early Church, development of the Nestorian doctrine and ultimately initiated the process of creating the so-called Church of the East. The teaching of the Church of the East as it developed throughout history should be distinguished from the initial Nestorian teaching. Theological differences quickly had political and socio-cultural implications at the global level (relationship with the Western Church as well as other Christian communities in the East).\n\nHistorically speaking, Nestorian Christians played an important role in bringing Christianity to China as well as other regions like Mongolia and India. The historical timeline of Nestorian Christianity depends on the region, socio-cultural setting and date of missionary penetration. \nThe bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) Nestorian stele (8th ct) from Xian witnesses to the early 7th century presence of Christians in the area. Nestorian Christians also reached India, and interacted with many other groups as Mongols, Turks, and Uigurs.  Members of the Nestorian community played an importan role during the Islamic period when they translated many works by Aristotle into Arabic (e.g. Timothy I). Modern Assyrian Church of the East is the successor of medieval Nestorian Christians, but its doctrine today should not be identified with Nestorius. After the disintegration of the Mongolian Empire during the 14th century, the Church of the East faced rapid decline. In the aftermath of these events, the presence of Nestorian Christianity was mainly reduced to India and Mesopotamia. During the 16h century, some members of the community united with the Roman Catholic Church and were named Chaldeans, whereas those who did not united with the RCC became known as Assyrians. Nestorian Christians faced persecutions in Persia during the 6th century, but flourished in China (7-10th ct), and was also well received during the medieval Mongolian period.",

    "description": "The GÄá¹apatya SampradÄya denotes a cluster of religious denominations whose worship and devotional systems are centered upon Gaá¹eÅa (Ganapati), the elephant-headed son of deities Åiva and PÄrvatÄ«. Members of the sampradÄya are also referred to as GÄá¹apatyas. Most modern Hindus regard Gaá¹eÅa as a god who helps petitioners overcome various kinds of obstacles. Reflecting this belief, he is usually invoked at the beginning of most formal pujas as a precautionary measure to ward off anticipated hindrances, hypothetical or otherwise. GÄá¹apatyas expand this common Hindu position to interpret Gaá¹eÅa as the supreme manifestation of the supreme reality (brahman). \n\nAlthough archaeological and scriptural evidence point to Ganesha's emergence as a recognizable deity in the first years of the common era, it is currently impossible to indicate a precise founding date for the GÄá¹apatyas. Paul Courtright, the renowned American scholar of Ganesha, identifies the duration from the 6th to the 10th centuries CE as the likely time span of their early development. Some texts report that at least 6 different GÄá¹apatya maá¹­has (institutions) existed contemporaneously with those established by the theologian Åankara in the 9th century CE. Between the 6th to the 16th centuries CE, historians have noted the construction of dozens of temples across North, West and Southern India with Ganesha enshrined as the principal deity. Additionally, scholars of Hinduism have called attention to the composition of different Puranas and Tantras during the same period that describe the elaborate rituals and mythologies of textually-grounded communities that self-identify with the GÄá¹apatya label. \n\nWhile they appear to have died out as an independent sampradÄya by the 17th century CE for reasons that will be illuminated in other sections of this entry, vestigial traces of GÄá¹apatya-like practices continue to be observed in most forms of Indian religion. These practices are especially pronounced in Marathi-speaking areas. Courtright correlates the emergence of neo-GÄá¹apatya movements in Maharashtra to political ascent of the Peshwas in the late 17th century. Appointed to serve as Prime Ministers at the court of the region's Maratha ruler, the Peshwas were largely derived from ChitpÄvan Brahmin caste and worshipped   Ganesha as their clan deity (kuladevatÄ). They pioneered an elaborate display of the scripturally-prescribed, autumn Ganesh Chaturthi at their palace in Pune's Old City; these embellishments added amplified levels of grandeur to a festival that was hitherto observed as a domestic ritual at a simpler scale, subject to the discretion of individual families. These celebrations served to rekindle popular interest in temporarily-forgotten GÄá¹apatya temples and the latter have since enjoyed a dramatic rise in patronage from Hindus of all sampradÄyas. \n\nIn the 1890s, the Pune palace's Ganesh Chaturthi ceremony was re-engineered by freedom fighter and religious reformer Bal Gangadhar Tilak into a festival celebrated almost entirely in the public domain. In the ensuing decade, the popularity of Tilak's remodeled ritual inspired the creation of countless \"Ganpati mandals\" (Ganesha committees) across Maharashtra, all dedicated to the organization of a 10-day long puja in honor of Ganesha that attracted participants from across the spectrum of Maharastrian castes. Scholars of Marathi religion like GS Ghurye and Anne Feldhaus have remarked that the universalization of Ganesh Chaturthi has enabled nationalists to itemize neo-Ganapatya beliefs as a distinctive marker of a Hindu-Marathi identity that continues to be mobilized in opposition to region's other religious influences. \n\nIn more recent years, the Mumbai-based Bollywood film industry has frequently highlighted the worship of Ganesha, thereby motivating the reproduction of Ganesh Chaturthi festivals in other Indian states and in international cities that have large populations of Indian immigrants. All of these details notwithstanding, the residue of Ganapatya worship constitutes an essential aspect of modern Hinduism. A deeper investigation of this sampradaya reveals significant insights qua the nature of Indian religion at disparate historical moments.",

    "description": "Unlike many other mystery cults in the Ancient World, the Cult of Isis capitalize on its exotic, Egyptian appeal. In this henotheistic cult, Isis, an attractive female figure, mother of Horus, and devoted wife to Osiris in the narratives, becomes the supreme deity alongside Osiris and Divine Providence that offers one solution to the theological crisis of the 2nd century AD (Gasparini). Her association to Greek and Roman goddesses ranged from Artemis to Aphrodite, as de Witt points out: in the Classical period Herodotus makes Isis equivalent to Demeter as a fertility goddess, but by the Empire Plutarch states that Isis was Mut and Atyhri as well as Athena. Elsewhere, Artemis and Isis were associated together. An aretalogy, moreover from Kyme, Asia Minor has Isis controlling even Fate whom even the normal Graeco-Roman gods obey. Finally, in Corinth, Isis becomes a goddess of the sea and trade, and the festival Isidis Navigium is celebrated for the beginning of the sailing season, and the celebration even entered the Roman Fasti (calendar) during the Empire. \nTurning to the myth of Isis in the Graeco-Roman world, no other literary texts gives a complete narrative than Plutarchâs de Iside et Osiride. Even Egyptologists, such as Gwyn Griffiths and Hani, refer to Plutarchâs text and consider him a good scholar on religious history. Furthermore, the cult of Isis appears in many Greek and Latin inscriptions and it also features prominently in book eleven of the novel Metamorphoses of Apuleius, where Lucius in the form of the ass enters the cult of Isis, is initiated, experiences a religious encounter with Osiris, and recovers his true human body. In the soteriological myth of the cult, Plutarch outlines how Isis resurrects Osiris who was dismembered under the moon and killed by Typhon (Sett). Isis manages to put the pieces of Osiris back together save his phallus â scholars have offered many attempts to solve this part of the myth, including that Isis knew of Osirisâ adultery with Nephthys. From the myth, comes the idea from Egyptian theology that Osiris is the judge of the dead, who, if the deceasedâs heart is lighter than a feather, would allow the deceased into his blessed and eternal abode. Isis becomes the benefactor of mankind, and the clear implication of the general narrative is that devotees of the cult of Isis had hope in life after death and that Isis may raise them up like Osiris. Thus, it comes to pass that, as Witt notes, the cult of Isis develops a priesthood, festivals days, its own calendar, and a litany of sacred texts, such as the Andros Hymn and aretalogies that are found throughout the Mediterranean world. In the hymn, Isis gives the holy word (hieros logos) whose symbol is the linen garb to those who are initiated into her mysteries. \nThe cult itself might have entered the Greek world during the Classical period, when the Athenian Assembly gave permission to some Egyptians to establish a temple to Isis in the Piraeus, as Simms has noted. From there on, in the Hellenistic Period, the Ptolemies â Greek rulers of Egypt â who used both Osiris and Isis to legitimize their pharaonic rule continue to spread cult activity primarily in Alexandria. Ptolemy I Soter was said to have invited a Timotheus to syncretize the Egyptian cult with Greek ideas, based on the Eleusian mysteries and Demeter worship (Witt). The Ptolemies and their wives, such as Arisinoe II, would continue to use the cult in order to establish their political authority by associating themselves with Osiris and Isis. From Alexandria, the cult spread to the rest of the Greek world and arrived to Delos. Scholars have traced that the cultâs arrival to South Italy originated from Delos when merchants were forced to flee due to conflict with the Seleuccids. In Italy, the cult can be found relatively early in the 3rd century BC in the Greek speaking portions â Sicily and Magna Graecia through numismatic and archaeological evidence, such as temples at Puteoli and Pompeii (RÃ¼pke). From there, in the 1st century BC, the cult of Isis enters Rome under Sulla, and the Pontifex Maximus Metellus funded the construction of an Isis shrine (Iseum Metellinum). The cult, however, did not enjoy immediate success. Among the non-aristocratic classes, the cult offered an alternative and a challenge of the authority of the Senate in competing with the gods of Jupiter and Venus (RÃ¼pke). The Roman Senate sought to ban the cult activities in the 50s and 40s BC and political violence involving factions of Pompey and Clodius involved members of the cult of Isis. During the Civil Wars, Antony and Cleopatra fashioned themselves as Osiris and Isis which led to Octavian, after his victory at Actium in 31 BC, to prohibit the cult from entering the pomerium of Rome. The hostility towards the cult reached its pinnacle in Tiberius when in AD 19, a Roman by the name of Mundus seduced a married Roman matron Paulina with the aid of the priests of the temple of Isis. Upon investigation, Tiberius banned the cult, destroyed the temple, crucified the priests, and banished Mundus into exile. From there, under Caligula and Nero, the cult of Isis enjoyed prestige and became one of the most popular mystery cults throughout the Mediterranean until the arrival of Mithraism and Christianity. With Theodosius edict to close all pagan temples in AD 394, the fate of the cult was pretty much sealed, although there is some evidence to suggest that in certain peripheral areas the cult lasted until the 6th century AD.",

    "description": "The Adi Dravida movement was an early-20th century Tamil Paraiyar-caste [Dalit] Buddhist community founded by the Tamil thinker-activist Iyothee Thass (1845-1914) and overseen by his organization, the Dravida Mahajana Sabha, during Thass's lifetime. Valluva Sakya Buddhism, the label by which Thass sought recognition for the Adi Dravida movement in the broader Buddhist world, was founded on a reading of Tamil history that positioned the Paraiyar caste, and specifically the Valluva Sakya subgroup of Paraiyars identified as descendents of Åakyamuni Buddha himself, as a class of religious specialists in a pre-Sanskritic [i.e., Dravidian], Tamil Buddhist society. Consonant with important cultural and intellectual trends in the early-modern Tamil country, which focused on the non-Sanskritic roots of ancient Tamil civilization, Thass's Adi Dravida movement was the first movement in the Tamil country to connect a Dravidian-focused reading of Tamil sociocultural history to a discrete program of caste reform and Paraiyar community activism, the hub of which was Thass's newspaper, \"(Oru Paisa) Tamiá¸»aá¹\" (\"One Paisa Tamilian\").  While at its peak the Adi Dravida movement boasted bustling communities in the Tamil country, Ceylon, Burma, and South Africa, Thass's death in 1914 led to the gradual decline of the Adi Dravida movement, and by the late 1920s most of the Adi Dravida activist community had adopted the rationalist-atheist Dravidianist model of anti-caste activism associated with E.V. \"Periyar\" Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement (suyamariyÄtai iyakkam). Although Thass's Adi Dravida Buddhism is no longer a major active community tradition, its influence can be observed in several realms of modern Tamil public society. First, the term \"adi dravida\", originally popularized by Thass's movement and taken up in E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement, became an official Tamil Nadu state government designation for Scheduled Caste communities, and remains a common label for these groups in present-day Tamil Nadu. Second, the surge of interest in recovering Dalit histories associated with Subaltern Studies and the formation of radical Dalit social activist groups in the latter half of the 20th century, in particular Tholkappiyan Thirumavalavan's Viduthalai Ciruthaigal Katchi (\"Liberation Panthers Party\"), a Tamil Dalit political party that follows Thass and Periyar in connecting the project of Dalit liberation with the project of Tamil cultural regeneration through the de-Sanskritization of Tamil society.",

    "description": "In the United States, the American Unitarian Association and Universalist Church of America merged in 1961 to form the Unitarian Universalist Association. Although Unitarians and Universalists were nominally Christian denominations, the Unitarian Universalists subsequently adopted the principles of free faith, in which each member unites in seeking truth and affirms each other's worth without the guidance of a particular doctrine or divinity. Now described as a liberal religious movement or post-Christian, Unitarian Universalists hold many different theological opinions and operate as a radically non-creedal body. There is a wide diversity of congregational structures and organizations and each group may self-describe as a church, society, fellowship, or temple, among other identifiers. Each Unitarian Universalist congregation is distinct in tone and content of worship, even within the same city, but each is guided by the seven Principles and six Sources. The Principles serve as a uniting guide and affirm the inherent worth and dignity of every person; justice, equity, and compassion in human relations; acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth; a free and responsible search for truth and meaning; the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process without congregations and in society at large; the goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all; and respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are part. The Sources include direct experience, words and deeds of prophetic people, wisdom from the worldâs religions, Jewish and Christian teachings to love our neighbors, humanist teachings and the guidance of reason and science, and spiritual teachings drawn from Earth-centered traditions. As a result, congregants draw from religious traditions such as Christianity or Judaism; spiritual practices of meditation, yoga, and connection to nature; and other influences including Paganism and New Age beliefs. Unitarian Universalists express strong commitment to social justice and action. They contend that spirituality and community extend beyond the walls of the congregation and must be lived in the world, and this message has spread beyond the borders of North America. The International Council of Unitarians and Universalists provides a network of organizations worldwide, including congregations throughout Africa; Europe and the UK; Australia and New Zealand; India, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Indonesia; the Caribbean; and in Central and South America. However, the tradition remains deeply affiliated with the West, as estimates indicate over 60% of Unitarian Universalists are in the United States and approximately 30% in Europe.",

    "description": "The NaqshbandÄ« Order refers to a range of Sufi brotherhoods beginning in Central Asia in the 14th century c.e. and spreading geographically through offshoots such as the NaqshbandÄ« MujaddidÄ« in South Asia during the 17th century and the KhÃ¢lidÄ« branches beginning in the 19th century within the Ottoman Empire. The namesake of the order BahÄÊ¾ al-DÄ«n Naqshband was born in 1318 c.e. and died in 1389 c.e. in a village near Bukhara known as Qasr Ê¿ÄrifÄn and studied under the KhwÄjagÄn Sufi master AmÄ«r Kulal. One of the common identifying features that distinguish NaqshbandÄ« order from others is itâs Silsila, or the chain of transmission of its teachings. While most Sufi orders trace the chain of transmission from the prophet Muá¸¥ammad through the fourth Caliph and first ShÄ«Ê¿Ä« imam âAlÄ« ibn Ê¾AbÄ« á¹¬Älib, the Naqshbandi trace their teaching through the first Caliph Abu Bakr Al-á¹¢adÄ«q. This is known as the NaqshbandÄ« âGolden Chainâ (Ar. Silsilat al-dhahab). Another unique feature of NaqshbandÄ« orders is the practice of âsilent recitation of Godâs nameâ (dhikr-khafÄ«) also known as âdhikr of the heartâ (dhikr al-qalb) as opposed to âvocal dhikr (dhikr-i jahrÄ«)â or âdhikr of the tongueâ (dhikr al-lisan). The practice of silent dhikr combined with an aversion to musical audition (samÄÊ¿) represent the âsoberâ rather than âintoxicatedâ expression of Sufism that characterizes the NaqshbandÄ« orders. Finally, the NaqshbandÄ« orders are characterized by a tendency toward social and political engagement. This is articulated in BahÄâ al-DÄ«n Naqshbandâs preference for âcompanionshipâ (suhbat) over isolation (khalwat), and the principle of âsolitude in the crowdâ (Per. khalwat dar anjuman) which stressed that followers need not abandon their trades or economic activity for the sake of spiritual pursuits reflecting a Malamati Sufi attitude toward âlivelihoodâ (kasb) prevalent in Central Asia. Along with another of Naqhbandâs eleven principles--âtravelling in oneâs homelandâ (safr dar watn)--Naqshbandi Sufis were encouraged to actively engage in society which may be seen from  âUbaydullah Ahrarâs (1404-1490) land-holdings and influence in Timurid politics, to the prominent role of the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya in resisting the Russian Empireâs expansion into the Caucasus during the 18th and 19th centuries.",

    "description": "The Pachomian monastic federation was a group of ultimately eleven monasteries, including two women's monasteries, affiliated under centralized leadership in Upper Egypt in the fourth to sixth centuries CE.  \n\nThe founder and central figure, Pachomius (c. 292-346), was born to a pagan family.  During his time serving in the Roman imperial army, he was inspired by the kind treatment he received from Christians, and ultimately embarked on an ascetic life.  He apprenticed himself to a local ascetic, after whose death he began his own community of ascetics.  After an unsuccessful first attempt, he established a monastery at Tabennesi (c. 323), the first of the monasteries that either were established or joined his federation over the course of the fourth century.  \n\nAfter Pachomiusâs death, there was a struggle to establish succession, but ultimately two more strong leaders, Theodore (d. 368) and Horsiesius (d. c. 387), took the reins and kept the federation thriving during their lifetimes.  Most of the primary source material we have dates to these eras.  We have much less data concerning the following century and a half, but the Pachomian federation appears to have continued during this period.  Sometime between 537 and 548, the Roman emperor Justinian I supplanted the Monophysite Pachomian leader Abraham with a Chalcedonian replacement, at which time many monks fled, effectively ending the existence of the Pachomian community.  \n\nThis group is sometimes described as the first Christian cenobitic monastic community, but this characterization is not strictly correct.  It was certainly the largest and most organized up to its time, but many others had been practicing a semi-removed ascetic and communal lifestyle for years already. For example, at least three of the eleven monasteries in the federation were not founded by the Pachomians, but joined the federation after independent origins.  The federationâs innovation instead came in its extensive organization in part facilitated by the Pachomian Rule, which provided a practical guide that helped in the regulation and functioning of the community.\n\nThe Pachomian legacyâs lasting influence is seen in other Christian cenobitic enterprises including Shenouteâs monastic community in Upper Egypt and Benedict of Nursiaâs monastic Rule.",

    "description": "Baul Fakir (Bengali: bÄul phakir) is a phrase used to describe decentralized and non-sectarian communities of sadhus, fakirs, and artists who most often come from either Hindu (most often Vaiá¹£á¹ava but sometimes Åaiva or ÅÄkta) and Muslim families.\n\nBÄul Fakirs are generally decentralized as a society, and authority is organized according to various lines of descent from a guru or murshid (both guru and murshid are used synonymously among BÄul Fakirs). Gurus, their students, and their devotees (bhaktas) meet together during periodic gatherings called sÄdhusaá¹ga, âgathering of adepts,â where formal meals are held and decisions are often made on various issues of interest to the wider community of Fakirs (also called sÄdhaks or sÄdhus) and FakirÄnis (also called sÄdhikÄs); these gatherings are often not only attended by BÄuls but also Hindu Tantric practitioners (tÄntrikÄs) and followers of Sufi pÄ«rs.\n\nBÄul Fakirs of all stripes are distinguished by their great reverence for the songs of LÄlan Fakir (d. 1890, also commonly rendered Lalon Sai or Lalon Shah). LÄlan is especially known for his criticism of sectarian religion or âbirth groupâ (jÄt) in his songs, early versions of which were later committed to writing and recorded in the notebooks of the celebrated poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941). However, respect is also accorded to other important BÄul Fakiri poets, such as PÄÃ±ju KhondakÄr (1851-1914, also PÄÃ±ju ÅÄh), an associate of LÄlanâs who seems to have contributed to the latterâs understanding of Islamic esoteric themes as well as his musical style of bhÄb-saá¹gÄ«t âmusic for reflection.â The songs of Duddu Shah (1841-1911), one of LÄlanâs direct disciples, as well as those of a wide variety of other artists as well as independent compositions are also commonly performed, but LÄlanâs songs are often given preeminence at most festivals in Bangladesh, due in large part to his cultural status and familiarity. In West Bengal, however, the tradition appears to be more decentralized, and the songs of other BÄul poets such as BhabÄ PÄglÄ (d. 1984) and RÄj KrÌ¥á¹£á¹a (1869-1946) as well as independent compositions are at least as prevalent as the songs of LÄlan.\n\nThe lyrics of BÄul songs accordingly contain references not only to Hindu PurÄá¹as but also to Sufi themes or symbols that relate to striving for the attainment (siddhi) of embodied self-realization, and to this end refer to practices as varied as reflecting on cosmology as expressed in terms of the Arabic alphabet and privately practicing sexual rites derived from medieval Tantric literature and syncretic oral tradition. The emphasis on the physical body has also led some scholars to view the community as having much in common with LokÄyata and CÄrvÄka beliefs on materialism.",

    "description": "The Knights Templars, or the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, were a Christian religious military order founded in the early twelfth century whose history is inextricably linked to the crusades. Originally founded to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land in the decades after the First Crusade from danger as they crossed through Muslim-controlled areas, the organisation soon expanded its duties. The orderâs knights, those men who were highly skilled in military warfare (at most around 10%), came to play an important role in the defence of the Crusader States, while non-combatant members managed a large economic structure throughout Christendom, making use of innovative banking techniques. \n\nAll took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and promised to devote themselves to God's service just as members of other religious orders did. Its constitution guaranteed the organisationâs structure form the mid-twelfth century onwards, at the top of which stood the Grand Master, initially stationed in Jerusalem (while under Christian control) and later in Acre. He was elected for life and assisted by other high-ranking members, including the Grand Commander and Marshal. Directly below were the provincial preceptors of the Templar territories who commanded the sergeants (or 'servientes'), non-elite members who had usually joined from the lower social classes and supported the knights on the battlefield or served as craftsmen or labourers. There were also priest-brothers within the Order who were responsible for the spiritual needs of all members. Both elite and non-elite members came from all over western Europe. \n\nThey initially found support among many secular and religious leaders, who made significant donations to the order in aid of their cause, thereby allowing the order to grow significantly and acquire great wealth. However, the tide began to turn at the end of the thirteenth century. At the end of the thirteenth century, little remained of the Crusader States which had been established nearly two centuries earlier and many resented the orderâs significant power. Finally, in 1307 King Philip IV of France order the arrest of every Templar in France, falsely accusing them of immorality and heresy. This move gained the support of Pope Clement V and led to the violent persecution and death of many members.",

    "description": "Amdo is a vast region on the Sino-Tibetan borderlands, which includes parts of Kokonor, South Gansu, and North Sichuan. Amdo is occupied by diverse communities, including Tibetan, Mongol, Monguor, Chinese and Turkic Muslims, etc. In the thirteenth century, Tibetan Buddhism developed thrivingly in Amdo during the reign of the Mongol Empire. As the middle ground between Tibet and China, Amdo became a critical cultural nexus of diverse cultures. In this context, Tsongkhapa, the Geluk School's founder, was born in Amdo. Starting from the fourteenth century, the Geluk School spread widely in Amdo. Because of the Khoshut Mongols' patronage after the late sixteenth century, the Gelukpa power rose promptly in Amdo. From the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, the development of the Gelukpa power in Amdo was directly related to the geopolitical policy of the Qing dynasty. Along with the Manchus and Mongols' patronage, the center of Amdo Gelukpas gradually moved from South Gansu to Kokonor. This significant phenomenon about Amdo Gelukpas was related to the westward movement of the Qing frontier policy. The development of the Gelukpa power in Amdo has several characteristics. Many Geluk monasteries took over institutional and religious legacies from other religious sects in Amdo, especially from the Sakya School. Along with the expansion of the Gelukpas in Amdo after the fifteenth century, many Amdo Buddhist communities converted to the Geluk School; however, they still preserved some original traditions and social practices in the pre-Geluk period. One of the most significant traits is the close connection between the Buddhist reincarnation system and local aristocratic power. It is widely known that the Sakya School's inheritance system is mainly based on kinship, especially the relationship between uncle and nephew. Because of the Mongol Empire's sponsorship, many Sakyapa priests and followers moved to Amdo and promptly dominated the region. After that, they established powerful local clans and monastic communities by practicing inheriting the Sakya School's lineage. In so doing, either monastic priests or local governors in the region were usually chosen from those families affiliated with the Sakya School. As both patrons and priests shared the same lineage, the political and religious powers tied together closely in Amdo. After these families gradually converted to the Geluk School after the fifteenth century, they still followed the inheritance system based on the patron-priest concept of the Sakya tradition, in which kinship played a critical role (See: Kung, 2018.). This unique phenomenon of the unity of politics and religion based on kinship profoundly influenced the historical development of Amdo Gelukpas until the early twentieth century. For instance, the Tenth Panchen Lama also held the Sakya lineage of the KhÃ¶n Family.",

    "description": "The Romanian Orthodox Church (henceforth ROC) is an Eastern Christian denomination. It represents the largest religious group in Romania (86.45% in 2011). Although the first evidence of Christianization of modern-day Romanian territories (Lower Moesia) dates back to the 3rd century, this entryâs time span runs from the achievement of the status of autocephalous Metropolis of Romania in 1885 â following the creation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 â up to the present day. The Metropolis of Romania was eventually raised to the rank of Patriarchate (its current jurisdiction) in 1925. The ROC is structured in Romania (thus excluding its dioceses abroad) into twenty-nine dioceses, fourteen of which have been established since 1990 (seven have been just re-opened after the communist leadership had disbanded them and another seven have been newly established). The Patriarch is the head and representative of the Romanian Orthodox Church, but decision making is the prerogative of the Holy Synod, which meets twice per year. The Holy Synod, which is the highest authority of the ROC, is formed by six Metropolitanates, sixteen Archbishoprics and thirteen Bishoprics with jurisdiction in Romania, plus some representatives for Romanian Orthodox communities abroad, including the Republic of Moldova. On a local scale, Bishoprics and Archbishoprics are divided in Protopopiates and, eventually, in parishes, which are the smallest units (Tateo 2020: 62).\nThe theological framework organizing the orthodoxy and the orthopraxis of the ROC is the same of the other eight Eastern Orthodox churches, which are all autocephalous but in full communion with one another. The Romanian Orthodox faithful worship with particular devotion Saint Nicholas, Saint Parascheva, Saint Filofteia, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saints Constantin and Elena, and Saint Dimitrie. The Orthodox Easter is the most important feast day of the year, while weekly services revolve around the Sunday mass. Pilgrimage to monasteries is a crucial form of religious practice which gathers thousands of believers every year: the Saint Parascheva is the largest one and takes place at the Metropolitan Cathedral of IaÅi on October 14th. The most popular Orthodox monasteries in Romania are Putna, MoldoviÅ£a, SuceviÅ£a, VoroneÅ£, Prislop, Cernica, and Sihastria.\n\nSource: Tateo, G. 2020. Under the Sign of the Cross.

    "description": "The word âBÃ¶nâ (Tib. Bon) represents a complicated and contested term, carrying various meanings across time, space, and different groups. Presently it usually refers to the more specifically called Yungdrung BÃ¶n (g.Yung drung Bon), literally âEternal Bonâ, on which this entry focuses â a religious tradition academically mostly taken as a school of Tibetan Buddhism. The other recognised main schools are: Geluk (dGe lugs), Nyingma (rNying ma), KagyÃ¼ (bKaâ rgyud), Sakya (Sa skya), and Jonang (Jo nang). Yet, BÃ¶n has historically maintained a strong non-Buddhist and minority identity, accentuating own appellation bÃ¶n in opposition to Buddhism, chÃ¶ (chos). Yungdrung BÃ¶n is currently spread, as the other schools, in the culturally Tibetan parts of the PRC â with largest communities in East Tibet (Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai Provinces); in the Himalayas: Nepal (Mustang, Dolpo, Kathmandu), following the post-1959 exile also in India (Himachal Pradesh, thinly in Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Ladakh), Bhutan, and growing globally: in Europe (with a monastery in France), USA, Canada, Mexico, Mongolia, and venturing into South-east Asia. \nAttested meanings of the term bÃ¶n refer to: (1) âbÃ¶npoâ (bon po) ritual specialists conducting funerary rites and invocations of deities in the Tibetan Empire (7th-9th century) controlling a great part of Central Asia, with âbÃ¶nâ likely denoting âritualâ; (2) all historical and contemporary Tibetan religious notions and practices that do not derive from Buddhism and Indian influences, i.e. mainly popular religion encompassing traditions sometimes labelled âshamanismâ; in an extended understanding non-Buddhist elements of Tibetan culture, a notion currently popular in Tibet and propagated by the PRC (along with strong Chinese historical impacts); (3) Yungdrung BÃ¶n; (4) (lha)bÃ¶n ((lha) bon), or sipÃ© lhabÃ¶n (srid paâi lha bon), local traditions generally lacking Buddhist influence unrelated to Yungdrung BÃ¶n, centred on mundane rituals, worshipping a range of own divinities, found in small areas of East Tibet and the Himalayas (mainly Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh). \nBÃ¶npos, adherents of Yungdrung BÃ¶n, have asserted own succession of the Imperial bÃ¶n, which they regard as an independent Tibetan autochthonous religious system, gradually suppressed by Buddhism (officially adopted by the Tibetan Empire in the 7th century) and a predecessor of bÃ¶n (2), (3), (4). According to historical evidence, Yungdrung BÃ¶n begun crystallising in the 11th century under the influence of Buddhism during its second diffusion in Tibet, developing monasticism and adopting other Buddhist features. Yungdrung BÃ¶n has thus shared cosmology, soteriological goals (awakening), and key features of ritual and spiritual practice with Tibetan tantric Buddhism, but has maintained more Tibetan non-Buddhist elements. The non-Buddhist identity is very strong and derives from own sources of tradition and lineages of power and teachings: divine founder of the religion TÃ¶npa Shenrap Mibo (sTon pa gShen rab mi bo), claimed to significantly predate Buddha Shakyamuni and hail from the Zhangzhung (Zhang zhung) kingdom in West Tibet; own canon: voluminous Ka (bKaâ, âThe Wordâ or âTeachingsâ) and Katen (bKaâ rten,  âSupport of Teachingsâ) collections; distinct iconography and details of material culture; also deliberate inversions of Buddhist categories (for instance anti-clockwise circumambulation).",

    "description": "A survey of Britain south of the future region of Hadrian's Wall from 55 B.C.E. to 286 C.E. Created by Sharon Paice Macleod. Sharon Paice Macleod is a Canadian Celticist, grant-funded researcher, author, teacher, and professional Celtic vocalist and musician. She was a Young Apprentice of the National Symphony Orchestra, and her undergraduate work was in Music Performance at Ithaca College and Berklee College of Music. She then trained in Celtic Studies through the Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University, and has since taught Celtic literature, culture, religion, mythology and folklore at Smith College and University of Massachusetts (Extension). In addition to numerous journal articles, her published works include 'Celtic Myth and Religion: A Study of Traditional Belief,' 'Celtic Cosmology and the Otherworld,' a contribution to 'Celtic Myth in the 21st Century: The Gods and their Stories in a Global Perspective' (University of Wales Press), and the forthcoming 'Early Celtic Poetry and Wisdom Texts.' Ms. Macleod has given honorarium presentations at Wellesley College, University College Cork, and the Ford Foundation Lecture Series, and is the Director of the EÃ³las ar Senchais Research Project, examining early Celtic instrumental music and vocal art forms in socio-religious context.\nIntroductory remarks: The dates for this timeframe extend from Caesar's raids on south-east Britain in 55 and 54 BCE through much of the Roman occupation of Britain, which was punctuated by a decade of British independence between 286 - 296 CE. In this era, we see the introduction of Roman military power and the gradual conquest of Britain. Aspects of Roman culture and religion are increasingly visible, and generally accessible to members of native British tribes. This was particularly the case in areas where British rule and administration were unavoidable or uncontested, and/or where tribes allied themselves with the Roman presence for benefits of trade and material culture, as well as military protection. Not all tribes participated to a high degree, however, and as a result we see varying zones of Romanization or assimilation. \nThe situation on the ground was varied and complex. Some British tribe offered little or no resistance, many of whom were located in the south-east of Britain (Corieltauvi, Catuvellauni, Dubunni, Atrebates, Cantiaci, Regni) as well as the Demetae in south-west Wales and the Dumnonii in the south-west peninsula. Hostile tribes offered strong opposition and revolt, some of which took the Romans many years to overcome (sometimes only containing rather conquering them); these included three tribes in Wales (Deceangli, Orovices, Silures) and the Durotriges in the south of Britain. More mixed responses and interactions, including very large military campaigns, involved the varied smaller tribes in the federations of the Brigantes, the Iceni and the Belgae.\nSome tribes remained hostile to Rome and only participated as much as was necessary to preserve their territory and population. As a result, for the sake of this query, we must envision zones where Romanization was accepted and zones where it had less or little effect. Therefore, the data provided below will include answers and notes that apply to tribes whose religion continued on as before (as much as was possible), mixed areas of influence, and areas of higher Roman influence. During this era we also see the beginning of the slow and gradual introduction of Christianity into the region, possibly in the third century and definitely by the fourth centuries, by way of contact with traders and artisans arriving from other regions. Christianity was one of several religions introduced to Britain from the eastern part of the region, including those dedicated to the veneration of deities like Cybele, Isis and Mithras. For much of this era, Christianity would have been a minority religion amongst the native British; the rate of Christianization amongst Romans would have been higher (although Roman paganism and syncretic Romano-Celtic paganism would have been present throughout). Christianity experienced a slow and steady growth in the Empire throughout the 3rd century, and was decriminalized in 260 CE. The presence of these religious groups and practices are marked (prior to presentation of data) as follows: NB [Native British Practices, as seen in the First Timeframe], RC [Mixed / Syncretic Romano-Celtic practices], and RP [Roman or Romanized practices]. There will also be reference to minority religions such as Mystery religions of eastern origin involving the veneration of Cybele, Isis and Mithras [ER], as well as early Christianity [EC].",

    "description": "Revered and reviled. Saints or devils incarnate. These and other stark dichotomies have dogged the Jesuits throughout their nearly five-century history. That history was born with a second birth; that is, the conversion of a Basque nobleman after the battle of Pamplona in 1521. A cannonball struck the knees of IÃ±igo Lopez shattering them and his hopes for a career as a courtier. Yet, instead of crippling him, the injuries he sustained transported him into a whole new life, the life of the spirit. His meandering path in the life of religion brought him to unexpected places from Montserrat, to Jerusalem, to Barcelona, to Paris and ultimately to Rome; and to a surprising destiny: the founder and first Superior General of a religious order, the Society of Jesus.\nPaul III officially approved of the Society on September 27, 1540 and in so doing ratified their first formula and institute in which the Jesuits laid out the plan for their common life. In that document the Jesuits commit themselves to a wide variety of ministries of the word including giving the Spiritual Exercises, striving for the progress of souls, partaking in works of charity, educating children and the illiterate. In addition to these pursuits, the Jesuits took a special fourth vow, beyond the three traditional evangelical vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, of obedience to the pope to undertake missions anywhere in the world. It was in these latter two capacities that the Jesuits became most famous. \nAs the Society rapidly grew from ten to one thousand from 1540 to 1556 so too did its commitment to education. While they were involved in some form of teaching from the outset, their first formal foray into schooling for primarily lay students began in 1548 with the foundation of their school at Messina, Sicily. After that date, schools quickly sprang up in nearly every city where there were Jesuits, and practically every place that did not have a Jesuit school wanted one. Devoted to a rigorous humanist education in the classics, grammar, rhetoric, and other burgeoning arts such as history, while maintaining their instruction in faith and good morals the Jesuits became the teachers par excellence of the early modern period. Indeed, students of the caliber of Moliere, Voltaire, Descartes, and many other attended their schools, which helped earn them their reputation for educational excellence. Even contemporaries, such as Francis Bacon, commended the Jesuit efforts in education in his own writings on education reform.  \nTheir schools were not limited to the confines of Europe. In fact, schooling was a major part of their missionary endeavors where they taught both Europeans and indigenous populations alike. The Jesuits were adept missionaries, with a unique style of accommodation. Their educational background in languages encouraged them to learn the languages of indigenous populations and prepare grammar books for those languages in an effort to teach others. Jesuits explored and frequently wrote about the new cultures they interacted with as well as the new environments, flora, and fauna they encountered. As a result, they published many ethnographies, but also letters that they sent on an annual basis to Rome, known as the Jesuit Relations. These letters electrified European audiences thirsting for knowledge of faraway lands and inspired many young men to become Jesuits. \nOutside of these two ventures the Jesuits also excelled in preaching, the study of theology, and even as patrons of the arts. They produced some of the greatest theologians of the time including Francisco Suarez and Robert Bellarmine. Similarly, they had relationships with the greatest artists of the day such as Michelangelo, Bernini, and even numbered the great painter and art theorist Andrea Pozzo among their own.\nStill, wherever the Jesuits succeeded they also seemed to draw harsh criticism. This was especially true in their missionary endeavors where detractors accused them of using the mission fields for the purpose of acquiring land and riches. Similarly, as theologians, many of their ideas became controversial. Dominicans and later Jansenists (including Pascal) accused them of neo-Pelagianism on account of their insistence on the role of free will in salvation. \nThese criticisms, added to various political intrigues, fueled the flames that eventually led to the general suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773. Over the two hundred and thirty three year history of the âOld Societyâ the Jesuits achieved many major accomplishments and earned the ire of many detractors. To some they were saints to others devils incarnate. They were reviled as much as revered.",

    "description": "Ancient Spartans, known also as Spartiates, lived in the city of Sparta, a settlement located in the region of southwest Greece known as the âPeloponnesosâ. Positioned between the between the Eurotas River and the Taygetos mountains, Sparta during the Archaic and Classical periods controlled a large territory that included the regions of Lakonia and Messenia. Having subjugated the native populations of these regions during a series of conflicts thought to have taken place during the 8th-7th centuries BCE, the Spartans instituted a systemâattributed to the quasi-mythical Spartan lawgiver Lycurgusâby which a small caste of full-citizen Spartiates were supported by the unfree agricultural and commercial labor of oppressed non-Spartan inhabitants of Lakonia and Messenia (known as âperioikoiâ and âhelotsâ). Uniquely unconstrained by agricultural or economic obligations, Spartiate males devoted the majority of their time to rigorous physical and military training from the age of seven onwards. The educational system at Sparta, supposedly another Lycurgan initiative, specialized in the cultivation of civic and martial virtues such as bravery, obedience, and self-control, as well as physical prowess and mental acumen; physical training for Spartiate women also existed to promote the generation of strong and healthy children. As a result of this system, the Spartans maintained one of the most powerful and respected armies in all of Greece during the Archaic and Classical periods, and it is this martial aspect of Spartan society that remains most well-known today. || \n\nBeyond the reputation of the Spartans as formidable warriors, however, many aspects of Spartan society remain shrouded in mystery. Little written evidence regarding Archaic and Classical Sparta has survived unto the present day, and of the ancient sources that do survive, very few of them record contemporary Spartan perspectives. FranÃ§ois Ollier first coined the term âle mirage Spartiateâ to describe this conundrum of attempting to reconstruct Spartan society from the testimony of outsider perspectives, most of which postdate the period in question and present an idealized account of Spartan society. Much of the ancient evidence concerning Sparta comes either from the period of Roman Greece, when Sparta was greatly admired by the Roman Empire, or from the 5th century BCE, when Sparta and Athens were locked in a struggle for the supremacy of Greece. Fueled by the ideological conflict and the perceived insularity of âconservativeâ Spartan society, 5th-century Athenian writers tended to project their feelings about Athensâwhether positive or negativeâonto the antithetical âblank canvasâ of Spartan society. || \n\nIf reconstructing Spartan society remains a difficult task on its own terms, then reconstructing Spartan religion is even more challenging due to the scarcity of written evidence and the strong localizing tendencies of Greek religion. During the Archaic and Classical periods, each city-state in the Greek world practiced its own expression of a more universal âGreek religionâ. Deeply embedded in a city-stateâs civic institutions, these so-called âpolis religionsâ fused local religious traditions with aspects of Panhellenic belief and practice. In reconstructing Spartan ritual practices and festivals, every attempt has been made to temper the accounts of later writers such as Pausanias and Plutarch by turning to the testimony of archaeological evidence, particularly that excavated from Spartan sanctuaries and shrines under the auspices of the British School at Athens. In the absence of -emic sources concerning Spartan religious beliefs and cosmology, much of this material has been reconstructed from the testimony of early Greek poets such as Homer and Hesiod. ||",

Sharon Paice Macleod is a Canadian Celticist, grant-funded researcher, author, teacher, and professional Celtic vocalist and musician. She was a Young Apprentice of the National Symphony Orchestra, and her undergraduate work was in Music Performance at Ithaca College and Berklee College of Music. She then trained in Celtic Studies through the Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University, and has since taught Celtic literature, culture, religion, mythology and folklore at Smith College and University of Massachusetts (Extension). In addition to numerous journal articles, her published works include 'Celtic Myth and Religion: A Study of Traditional Belief,'  'Celtic Cosmology and the Otherworld,' a contribution to 'Celtic Myth in the 21st Century: The Gods and their Stories in a Global Perspective' (University of Wales Press), and the forthcoming 'Early Celtic Poetry and Wisdom Texts.' Ms. Macleod has given honorarium presentations at Wellesley College, University College Cork, and the Ford Foundation Lecture Series, and is the Director of the EÃ³las ar Senchais Research Project, examining early Celtic instrumental music and vocal art forms in socio-religious context.\nIntroductory remarks: The culture and religion of Iron Age Britain displays many similarities with other Celtic-speaking regions, including northern Britain, Gaul, Ireland, Celtiberia, Galatia, and Celtic-speaking regions of Continental Iron Age Europe. These similarities - as well as divergent beliefs and practices - were widely remarked upon by numerous Classical authors. In this timeframe, similarities in culture and religion were commented upon by Julius Caesar in De Bello Gallico (V, 14 and VI, 13) during his raids on southern Britain in 55 and 54 BCE; as well as by Strabo in his Geographica (IV, 5, 2) c. 23 BCE and other commentators. Primary evidence will be drawn from archaeology in Britain and Classical accounts, with useful comparative materials from related cultural regions given above. In addition to the many print sources given below, the bibliographies of each of these resource will provide researchers with ample additional books and journal articles on specific topics.",

    "description": "Sachchai is a loosely organized group of believers who aim to heal their suffering and illnesses through the means of Bible study, ritual exorcism, and speaking in tongue. Sachchai is rapidly spreading across villages and towns in Nepal. Hundreds of thousands of believers have embraced it. More than ninety percent of the believers are women who mostly are from poor and low-caste backgrounds. Sachchai claims to be an inclusive, egalitarian, and universal group. People from any religious and cultural background are welcome and they do not need to abandon their past religions and cultures. But the believers are required to believe in Jesus and study the Bible. Other synchretist faith-based groups like Sachchai are also found in South Asia. For example, Christ-Bhakta followers in Tamil Nadu, India, who identify themselves as Christ-Bhakta Hindus, and Jesus Imandars in Bangladesh, who identify themselves as Isa-Muslims (JÃ¸rgensen 2008; Kuttiyanikkal 2014) . Both these groups study the Bible but do not disassociate themselves from their past religions.   \n\nSachchai was established by Christian evangelicals in the late 1970s in India but could not prosper until the first decade of the 21st century when it got fertile ground in Nepal. Extreme political instabilities, huge international labor migration of men, dire lack of public services, and, most importantly, rising domestic violence against women, all have contributed to the rapid expansion of Sachchai. Hindu nationalists and Christians in Nepal both have considered Sachchai as a threat to them.",

    "description": "A Jewish community of people who lived in Northwestern Ethiopia and shared a common language, culture, and history until a majority of the community emigrated to modern Israel in the 1980s and 1990s (1984-1991) in the aftermath of a series of social, political, and economic crises, commonly referred to as the Aliyah from Ethiopia. Approximately 150,000 Ethiopian Jews currently reside within Israel. 5,000 Ethiopian Jews remain in Northwest Ethiopia where they have waited over 20 years to migrate to Israel. Those who migrated to Israel during the aliyah have settled in a variety of cities within modern Israel where they have continued to maintain their ritual practices and cultivate new religious traditions and beliefs. Separated from Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jewish communities, Ethiopian Jews have cultivated their own ritual traditions, including dance, music, ideas about the Sabbath, and the practice of legal interpretation. In particular, debates and questions about Ethiopian Jews' knowledge of the Talmud or Oral Torah of Judaism persist with Israel's chief religious institution, the Rabbinate, refusing to categorize Ethiopian Jewish authorities, known as the kesim, as rabbis due to their perceived lack of knowledge of the Oral Torah. However, in 2018 the Israeli government formally recognized the kesim as the religious leaders of Ethiopian Jews and promised to put twenty kesim on the government payroll. Formal recognition of the kesim always involved instituted a government committee over the kesim which would supervise and regulate their activities. Some have criticized this attempt to formally recognize the kesim and argued that it will cause more problems and issues with the government now given the right and ability to survey and regulate Ethiopian Jewish authorities. As a result of these ongoing political complexities over the status of Ethiopian Jews, their legal status as Jews has and continues to be increasingly called into questioned and debated. In recent years, Ethiopian Jews living in Israeli cities have increasingly confronted social, economic, and political discrimination in the country which have led to widespread national protests and confrontations with authorities. While discrimination and marginalization remain persistent issues, Ethiopian Jews have increasingly integrated into Israeli institutions, including Israel's leading hi-technology companies, social services, and government agencies, with the first Ethiopian Jewish woman elected to a ministry position in May of 2020.",

    "description": "The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)\nThe Religious Society of Friends, better known by the once derogatory and later reclaimed moniker âQuakers,â are a historically Christian group. One of many small religious sects to emerge in the wake of the English Civil War, the Quakers formed under the inspiration of the teachings of George Fox, a weaver turned preacher who elevated the âpriesthood of the believerâ to a hitherto unseen extreme. Fox argued for the abolition of the priesthood (or the laity, as Friends might say), in favor of a Christian community modeled on Foxâs understanding of the early church, one in which all were called to ministry and equally able to communicate with a divine âLight Within.â Fox and the early Friends seem to have been a premillenarian sect who felt Christâs return was immanent and prepared accordingly, but by the 1670s the Friends had begun to internalize the second coming and institutionalize in earnest. Friends became notorious throughout England for the uniqueness of their theological and social practicesâworshipping in silence, eschewing paid ministers and tithes, refusing to use the âpaganâ names of months and days, adopting plain clothes and the informal âthouâ in place of the honorific âyou,â refusing to doff hats for anyone but the Lord, and, most importantly, their refusal to swear oaths in courts of law (after Matthew 5:34) which led to their frequent imprisonment.\nEven after the Friends were granted formal toleration in the Toleration Act of 1689, a number chose to immigrate to the New World, driven by economic and religious motivations. Though Friends began arriving in the Americas as early as 1655, they founded their most influential settlement in Pennsylvania (awarded as a charter to Quaker William Penn in 1681 to repay a lien owed his father), where Friends remained the dominant force in the legislature until 1756, when they resigned en masse rather than dedicate taxes for the French and Indian War, objecting on pacifist grounds. Though never a numerically significant portion of the American population, Friends assumed outsized importance in American religious history by spearheading a variety of social movements: The American abolition movement, womenâs suffrage, Native American rights, and pacifist movements all have Quaker origins and inspirations.\nA series of schisms split the American Quakers in the nineteenth century, following the trajectory of many Protestant denominations at the time. The most significant was the 1827 Orthodox-Hicksite split, the Hicksites rallying around the teachings of Elias Hicks, who taught that Jesus became Christ but was not born divine, and that any modern Friend who might follow Jesusâ example in discerning the will of the Inward Light within all. For Hicks, the Bible was valuable as one source among many attesting to Godâs previous revelations but was not the unique word of God and should be subordinated to reason and experience. Orthodox Friends, by contrast, affirmed the traditional Christian beliefs that Christ was the sole Son of God who was sent to earth to redeem humanity by dying on the cross. Orthodox Friends increasingly integrated with other Protestant denominations in both theology and practice, while Hicksite Friends grew closer with other progressive denominations active in social movements. The split foreran the two most important Quaker bodies today, the liberal Friends General Conference (FGC) and evangelical Friends United Meeting (FUM). FGC Friends have maintained the distinctively quiet (âunprogrammedâ) style of Quaker worship but are arguably post-Christian, while FUM meetings are effectively Protestant. The two groups share little with one another except competing claims to a shared spiritual lineage and the Quaker name itself. \nThe Quakers were not historically known for missions after their initial proselytization efforts in the seventeenth century, but a series of successful international missions initiated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have led to large Quaker communities in Kenya, Burundi, Guatemala, and Bolivia. These international meetings are typically, though not invariably, affiliated with either the Evangelical Friends or the Friends United Meeting, and so more closely resemble other Protestant Christian churches than the more liberal FGC Friends. Over a third of the worldâs Quakers live in Kenya, the likely provenance of the next stage of Quaker history.",

    "description": "Church of All Worlds (CAW) began April 7, 1962 at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, when two freshman psychology students shared a glass of water. Inspiration for this sharing of water came from a science fiction book they had both read: Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein. In this book Valentine Michael Smith, a young human who was raised on Mars, experiences the ills our world and uses his training as a Martian to address them. In order to achieve this, he starts a church. That church was called the Church of All Worlds. These two college students, Lance Christie and Tim Zell (who now goes by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart), looked at this religion and thought âit was fiction so good is should be true,â and thus they engaged in the most holy of Martian traditions, water sharing. \n\nBy 1963 they had officially started the Church of All Worlds. Over the following five decades the group grew to have major influence on alternative religion in America. Adding to their science fiction roots they adopted aspects of the growing environmental movement, western esoterism, and human potential psychology. They found themselves at the center of a number of the social movements that the 1960s and 70s have become famous for. They coined the term polyamory. They were one of the first (or the first according to some sources) group to refer to themselves proudly as âpagan.â. They helped develop many of the rituals and traditions that would become the Neo-Pagan tradition. They fought a battle with the IRS to become one of the first tax-exempt organizations to identify as part of this tradition. They published the âGreen Egg,â one of the most important Neo-Pagan magazines. The founders even raised living unicorns at one point. \n\nThe Church has also experienced many ups and downs. At its height in the late 90s, they numbered around 1200 due paying members, with many more coming their festivals, engaging in their rituals, and working alongside them in both their magazine, a number of store front locations and at ANNWN, their sacred land in Northern California. The Church still exists today though its membership is much smaller, with less than a hundred due paying members in the United States. Still, the group continues to attract new adherents, its founder, Oberon Zell, maintains a busy schedule of speaking engagements and writing projects. In 2004 Zell opened the Grey School of Wizardry, an online magick school self-consciously based on Hogwarts, from the Harry Potter novels. Showing that many still keep their science fiction roots close, remaining invested in a sense of play, creativity, and a keen eye for popular culture.",

    "description": "Groups of Jesus-followers (aka \"Christians\") in the city of Ephesus and its environs, in the second and third centuries of the Common Era, prior to the official recognition of Christianity as a state-sanctioned religious group. The earliest Jesus movement missionary connected with Ephesus is Paul, who is said to have resided in Ephesus in the mid-1st century CE and who provides evidence for an early \"church\" there. In the second century, traditions developed identifying a spot on the nearby Ayasoluk Hill as the burial place of apostle John; there developed a tomb cult that would eventually become an important Christian holy site and pilgrimage destination. By the end of the third century, Ephesus had grown into a central hub of the burgeoning Christian movement, famous for its associations with the apostles Paul and John, presaging its later place among the civic centers of imperial Christianity. \nBesides Paulâs letters, other early Christian texts connected with Ephesus include the pseudo-Pauline Pastoral Epistles, the Johannine Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, the Book of Revelation, Ignatius' Letter to the Ephesians, and the apocryphal Acts of John. The latter two sources are our best witnesses to second century Christianity in the area, though the contested provenance of the Acts of John renders its historical utility dubious. Collectively, our sources for early Christianity in Ephesus attest to a substantial, though still marginal, presence of Christian groups in the city in the first three centuries. Almost all of our earliest sources attest to conflict between groups associated with the city, suggesting that Christianity there was comprised of a diverse collection of groups. \nThe partial and highly stylized nature of our earliest sources, however, frustrate attempts to discern reliable sociological information, especially whether and how Ephesian Christians were distinct from other Christian groups, Jews, and Greco-Roman polytheists. Scholars have sometimes suggested that an early Pauline strand of Christianity was \"overtaken\" by a competing Johannine tradition (see DRH entries on \"Pauline\" and \"Johannine\" Christianities for more on these groups), but our sources prevent any kind of clarity on that front. Utilizing material and literary evidence, Katherine Shaner has recently suggested that women and enslaved people played prominent roles in the earliest Christian communities in Ephesus. \nThis entry combines reconstructions of general early Christian beliefs and practices (in all their diversity), supplemented by insights drawn from texts connected specifically with Ephesian history and culture.",

    "description": "The Nyingma, or âAncientâ lineage refers to the oldest of the four major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. Distinguished from followers of the later Sarma (Tibetan: gsar ma) lineages, which includes the Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu, and later Gelug, Nyingma refers to those who adhere to the earliest (pre-tenth century) translations of Buddhist teachings arriving in Tibet, as well as a series of treasure (T: gter ma) text revealed from the eleventh century onwards. Renowned for their adherence to a range of esoteric, predominantly tantric Buddhist practices, as well as unorthodox behavior, Nyingma followers served as motivation for periodic reforms throughout Tibetan history, each allegedly âreturningâ to the ethical roots and meditative discipline of Indian Buddhism. \n\nAccording to the Nyingma lineage, the primordial teacher is Samantabhadra (T: kun tu bzang po). Depicted without clothing and vivid blue in color, he represents the untainted wisdom of the all Buddhas of the three times and ten directions. In human form, the Nyingma lineage finds its roots in the Indian master Padmasambhava (T: pad+ma 'byung gnas) who is credited with introducing the first coherent and comprehensive presentation of the Buddhist path to Tibet. He is often referenced along with Shantarakshita (Sansrkit: ÅÄntaraká¹£ita), the great Indian pandit, and Vairotsana (T: bai ro tsa na), the great translator, delineating the three most important early Nyingma thinkers. The historical center of the lineage is found in Samye (T: bsam yas) monastery in central Tibet. Constructed in the eighth century, Samye monastery was the first successfully constructed monastery in Tibet. After years of wrestling with demons, King Trisong Detsen (T: khri srong lde btsan), requested Padmasambhava to subjugate the antagonistic demon, which he did, and the monastery was miraculously completed overnight. \n\nRenowned today for their erudite descriptions of the Great Completeness (T: rdzogs pa chen po) meditative system, the Nyingma lineage experienced a resurgence in the fourteenth century with the renowned scholar-yogi Longchen Rabjam (T: klong chen rab âbyams). Longchenpa, as he is commonly referred to, both revealed new treasure teachings and consolidated much of the existent tantric materials found within the early Nyingma lineage. His extensive writings on topics such as the nine vehicles (T: theg pa dgu; a defining religious shema of the Nyingma, the subtle body, meditation practice, and most importantly the Great Completeness, revived the Nyingma lineage during and after his life. \n\nExtending across the Tibetan plateau to include all three Tibetan states (Utsang, Kham, and Amdo), as well as Bhutan and modern-day Indian state of Ladakh, the Nyingma lineage flourished in many sub-lineages throughout the centuries, resulting in a vibrant array of contemplative and scholarly practices.",

    "description": "Vasco-Aquitanian religion is documented primarily through the epigraphic remains of votive dedications, inscribed contractual obligations and gifts establishing a relationship with a deity, erected by private and public individuals in the central and western Roman Pyrenees and northern and southern foothills and hinterlands of the range. The bulk of these dedications to local deities occurred in the first two centuries CE. We cannot determine the contours of the priestly hierarchy or the religious institutions of Vasco-Aquitanian religion as  no recorded priests (sacerdotes, flamines, or local offices) are known epigraphically. There are differences between religious features among the Pyrenean Aquitani and the Vascones of Hispania Tarraconensis, but many similarities. The bulk of our evidence comes from the Pyrenees for this religious group. The greatest concentration of Vasco-Aquitanian deities occurs in the territory of the town of Lugdunum Convenarum (mod. Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges). That town, said to be founded in 72 BCE by Pompey, features few Vasco-Aquitanian gods but primarily Roman deities. By contrast the hinterland of the town, where most of the industrial operations of the Convenae occurred, features the bulk of votive dedications to local deities with  Vasco-Aquitanian deities or Latin-named deities clearly masking local gods. Several of these deities, such as Fagus \"Beech Tree\", Sex Arbores \"The Six Trees\", Arixo (\"oak\", cf. Basque hartiz \"oak\"), Artehe (\"Holm Oak\", cf. Basque arte),  Leherennus (\"Pine\", cf. Basque leher), Erriapus (\"The Stone One\", cf. Basque harri \"stone\"), and Ageio are linked to sites of industry or traditional economic activities, such as silvopastoralism, pitch production, iron mining, and marble quarrying. There seems to be evidence of corporate worship of certain of these economic gods by individuals connected with large-scale industries, above all marble quarrying and iron mining. For example several collective dedications exist at or near the sites of work by those who seem to have been physically involved with that work: CIL XIII 1384 (Asque / Bigerriones): Ageio deo / pagani / Ferrarienses / ex voto \"To the god Ageio, the pagani Ferrarienses ('iron mining contract laborers' or 'residents of the iron-mining district') set this up to the god Ageio in fulfillment of a vow\", and  AE 1951, 233 (Saint-Beat / Lugdunum Convenarum): Deo / Erria/pe v(otum) s(olverunt) / marmo(rarii) / omnes \"All the marble workers fulfilled their vow to the god Erriapus.\" Some scholars have conflated such gods with \"natural worship\" in the past without connecting it to similar economic motivations underpinning votive usage elsewhere in the Roman world. The votive dedications of the Convenae and other populations in the Roman Pyrenees, as elsewhere in the Mediterranean, reveal deities closely linked to the lived realities of their dedicants. The beliefs about and the mythologies of these gods are beyond access to us but perhaps remain alive in elements of Basque folklore.",

    "description": "A community of Orthodox believers in Ukraine who abide to the standards and practices of the Orthodox religion renewed in the course of Petro Mohyla's (1597-1647) reforms in the seventeenth century. Petro Mohylaâs reforms were motivated by religious competition in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn the 1620s, aristocratic dynasties that traditionally supported the Orthodox Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth either converted to Catholicism, or disappeared. However, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, received a new supporter in the figure of the Cossacks, armed men of diverse social backgrounds. In 1620, the Cossacks helped to elect a new metropolitan for the part of the Orthodox Church that did not recognize the superiority of the Pope. In 1632, the Polish king recognized equal rights between the restored Orthodox Church and the Uniate, Catholic and Protestant Churches of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1633, Peter Mohyla, an energetic scion of an aristocratic Moldavian family, became the head of the Kyivan Orthodox Church.\nMohylaâs tenure as the metropolitan marked the beginning of an important period in the history of the Ukrainian and Belorussian Church, characterized by reforms in religion and education. The learned circle of Petro Mohyla modernized the existing theological literature and introduced new genres such as collections of miracles and moral theology into the Orthodox use. To unify the liturgy and teaching of the Orthodox Church, Mohyla initiated a revision and publication of the âcritical editionsâ of the main books of the Church such as the and the Missal (1629), the Orthodox Confession of Faith (1640), the Euchologion (1646). Trying to raise the status of the Orthodox Church in the Commonwealth, Mohyla and his circle closely followed the Catholic example of ecclesiastical modernization and even made steps to prepare the Orthodox Church in Ukraine for the second Union with the Catholic Church. Mohyla justified using Latin sources by saying that âthere exist few Slavonic books on theology, and none at all on politics. Greek books are difficult to obtain, and they cost too much, while Latin books on these subjects are readily available (Charipova, 261). To address the problem of education, Mohyla founded the Kyivan Collegium modeled on the example of Jesuit academies in the Commonwealth in 1632. Changes in religious life also brought transformations in the religious art and architecture. New genres of theatrical plays on religious became popular and popularized by the Kyivan Collegium. The new influences became noticeable in iconography that emphasized the cult of the Mother of God and Marian piety.  \nThe followers of Petro Mohyla accepted fundamental works created during Mohylaâs timeline and developed new theological genres. The most prominent works produced by the generation that followed  Mohyla included collections of sermons by Lazar Baranovych (1620-1693), treatises on moral theology by Innocentyi Gizel (1600-1683), collections of miracles by Ioanykyi Galiatovsâkyi (1620-1688). This generation of religious scholars made a considerable influence on the Russian Orthodox Church by bringing new types of books to Russian markets and setting new standards for education, preaching and church discipline.",

    "description": "The Moravian Church or the Unitas Fratrum, originated in early 15th century Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic. Moravians were the first large-scale Protestant Missionary movement, spreading across the globe. Missionary work, ecumenism, personal piety and an emphasis on liturgical music and worship are tenets of the Moravian faith. This entry focuses on Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut, the Inuit self-governing region of northern Labrador. It tracks social changes along several centuries of occupation, as well as how Inuit resisted and accomodated Moravian beliefs and sociality. Moravians first journeyed to Labrador in 1752, after Johann Christiann Erhardt, a newly converted seaman, traveled to Greenland, where Moravians had started to evangelize Inuit in 1733, using to their advantage the connections to the Danish court of their leader Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700-1760). Erhardt became convinced that he would be able to communicate with and interact with Inuit across the Strait in British North America after reading travel accounts depicting Inuit in Labrador. The first attempt to establish a mission in Nisbet's Harbour failed, with members of the expedition supposedly killed. In 1771, the first permanent Moravian community is established on the Labrador Coast and called Nain, and soon follows a mission station at Okak in 1776, and Agvituk (now known as Hopedale) in 1777. Missionaries chose locations to set up stations based on Inuit hunting, fishing, and whaling grounds, hoping that establishing themselves near historical winter camps would encourage Inuit to \"settle\" near them. This \"settling\" was instrumental to the conversion process. It allowed missionaries to keep watch over Inuit, encourage them to attend Church and festivals, and gave them a large amount of control over the flow of European goods. Control over trade meant control over Inuit subsistence activities, as Inuit converts were obligated to participate in the Moravian cod and fur economy, rather than spending their time hunting whale and caribou, which Moravians discouraged. In 1831, a mission station was established at Hebron, located 80 miles north of Okak, in 1865 a mission station was established at Zoar south of Nain, in 1871 a sixth station was established at Ramah (it would be closed in 1907), in 1896 a mission station was established at Makkovik, and in 1904 the eighth and final Moravian mission station opened at Killinek, at the northern tip of Labrador. The Moravian missions in Labrador struggled financially throughout its history. Events that stand out include the 1918 Spanish Flu in Labrador, which killed more people proportionally in Nunatsiavut than anywhere else on earth, with a mortality rate of 71% at Okak and Hebron. The Spanish Flu was brought to Labrador by way of the annual Mission supply ship and spread rampantly through the coast. Because of the remoteness of the Labrador coast, missionaries served as doctors and administrators, as the governmental presence was minimal. Moravians, along with the provincial government, ran the residential schools in the region and were responsible for intense physical, sexual, and psychological trauma of Inuit children during the mid-late 19th century. The last missionary left Nunatsiavut in 2005, the same year that the region became self-governing. Community members continue to carry on certain Moravian traditions and many self-identify as Moravian, serving as ministers in their own communities. Many Nunatsiavut Inuit have also called for there to be a reckoning with the colonial violence inflicted by Moravian missionaries, particularly surrounding residential schools. Youth have also taken up the cause for a re-evaluation of Moravian presence in Nunatsiavut. There is currently a youth-led movement to change the name of schools on the coast named for Moravian missionaries such as Jens Haven Memorial School in Nain and Amos Comenius in Hopedale.",

    "description": "In 1787, roughly a decade after Americaâs independence from Great Britain and almost a century before Black Americans were guaranteed U.S. citizenship, a group of Black congregants walked out of Philadelphiaâs primarily white St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in the middle of the Sunday service. One of these protesters, Black Methodist minister Richard Allen, eventually founded Americaâs first independent Black denomination and its oldest formal Black institutionâthe African Methodist Episcopal Church. Described by W.E.B. Du Bois as the worldâs âgreatest Negro organization,â the AME Church is a Protestant Christian denomination aligned doctrinally with the United Methodist Church and organized in an Episcopal system. \n\nTo tell the story of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one must first turn to the history of Methodism, its antecedent. Originated by English minister John Wesley, the transatlantic denomination became ubiquitous in eighteenth and early nineteenth-century America through the revivals of the First and Second Great Awakening. Historians often remark on the egalitarian and democratic nature of these revivals. While it is important for us not to romanticize early Methodism, thereby ignoring Black people's experiences of discrimination and systemic racism within the religious culture and society more broadly, we can still recognize that some enslaved people managed to make a home for themselves within the Methodist fold and, to some extent, were even accepted into communal worship spaces. The fact that services were held in large, open-air fields created a come-one, come-all atmosphere, and ecstatic, embodied worship experiences were customary. It was into this Methodist culture that Richard Allen was converted as a seventeen-year-old enslaved person in 1777. And ten years later, when he led a group of Black Methodists out of St. George's, it was as a consequence of this Methodist culture that he protested. \n\nWhile the Methodism to which Allen had been introduced as a young man was more open to Black congregants, the religious culture he experienced at the turn of the eighteenth century was increasingly stratified by race. Although sizable numbers of Blacks had been evangelized by Methodists and even licensed to preach in the mid-1700s, white Methodists started to neglect earlier ideals of acceptance in lieu of pursuing respectability and becoming an established church. Among other practices, white Methodists began to deny Black members leadership roles within the denomination and some white Methodist preachers even refused to hold Black babies during infant baptisms, as historian Julius H. Bailey has shown. Separating from St. George's signified Allenâs rejection of the inequitable treatment of African Americans in Methodist spaces, his recovery of early Methodismâs egalitarian ideals and his articulation of a new religious vision that embraced the humanity of Black Americans. After starting a church of his own in 1794 (Mother Bethel AME), Allen and a collective of other Black Methodists established their own denomination in 1816 with Allen as the organizationâs first Bishop. \n\nCommitments to racial justice and what twentieth-century AME minister and theologian James H. Cone would later name Black liberation theology have served as the cornerstones of the two-hundred-year-old denomination. In the antebellum period, AME churches served as posts for the Underground Railroad. During Reconstruction, Northern AME missionaries travelled southward to teach formerly enslaved people how to read. Today, AME churches provide community programming that, according to their mission statement, aims to âenhance the entire social development of all people.â Furthermore, missionization, particularly in Africa, has been a primary component of the churchâs work, leading to the establishment of the denomination in over thirty countries.",

    "description": "Chan Buddhists refer to the religious practitioners of Chan, reflected in the Chan texts like ârecorded sayingsâ and âlamp transmission.â It is believed that the legendary figure Bodhidharma from India first brought Chan to China. Eminent Chan patriarchs, especially the Sixth Patriarch Huineng (638â713), developed Chan Buddhism during the Tang-Song periods. When it came to the seventeenth century, the reprint and publication of abundant Chan texts marked the revival of Chan Buddhism in the early Qing Dynasty. Divided into two major lineages (Caodong and Linji), Chan Buddhists frequently used âencounter dialoguesâ and the act of beating and shouting to express their understanding of awakening. Chan Buddhism emphasizes intuition over textual study, the role of meditation in cultivating oneâs mind, and the importance of master-disciple relationship in the transmission of dharma. Chan Buddhists affiliated with the same lineage were loosely organized as a group as shown in the documental evidence of dharma transmission. The Chan Buddhists disputed with each other about the criteria of enlightenment and the authenticity of the lineages of dharma transmission in their textual works, which stimulated the revival of Chan Buddhism in the seventeenth century. The religious group not only includes elite Chan Buddhists who authored voluminous works, but also common Buddhists and lay people who practiced Chan.",

    "description": "The term âimperial cultâ refers to the worship of the emperor and imperial family throughout the Roman Empire. Two factors make classifying and clarifying the practice of imperial cult difficult. First, religion was not separate from the political and secular sphere at Rome; as such it is difficult to determine whether the imperial involvement in religious practice was primarily driven by religious impulses as opposed to political motives. Second, because of the diversity of the Roman Empire, there is no unity to the practices of emperor worship. (In general, we distinguish between cultic observance in the Eastern empire, Western empire, and at Rome.) Bearing these two factors in mind, the following is an attempt to chart the beginnings of imperial cult under the Julio-Claudian emperors. \r\n\r\nThe Augustan principate marked the transition between Republican and Imperial forms of government. However, the regime operated on the premise that Augustus, who was, post-Actium, simply an ordinary Roman citizen, restored the Republic. This faÃ§ade made the operations of the cult especially problematic and the imperial household was deliberately obscure in the language it used to describe cultic activity (cf. Rives: 2007). Augustus himself was the son of a god: Julius Caesar had been divinised. Caesarâs career proved a beneficial model for articulating imperial divinity. Augustus used his divine genealogy to create an aura of specialness around himself; but he was equally aware that Caesarâs regal and divine posturing had contributed to sending him to an early grave. For more on Caesar and the cult see Weinstock: 1971.\r\n\r\nMost scholars understand the worship of the emperor in the eastern provinces as a continuation of the customary practice of ruler-cult (cf. Cerfaux and Tondriau: 1957; Fears in Grant and Kitzinger ed. 1988; Klauck: 2003; Taylor: 1979). Augustus would not be unprecedented in this. Roman officials had received divine honours in eastern cities before (e.g. Marcus Claudius Marcellus in Syracuse from 212BC onwards); however, these examples are confined to single cities. Thus, a development came in 29 BC when temples to Augustus and the goddess Roma were granted to provinces in Asia and Bythinia-Pontus. However, the acceptance of these temples can be interpreted as an established method of assimilating Roman rule with the practices of the region.\r\n\r\nProvinces requested the emperorâs permission before building temples to him and there are many examples of requests denied. It was common early on for the emperor to be associated with the goddess Roma as a way of softening the claim to divinity. In 15BC Hispania Tarraconensis gained permission for a temple to Augustus and Rome (cf. Fishwick: 2014) and in 12BC three provinces of Gaul established an altar to Augustus at Lugdunum (Livy, Epit. 139). These examples set a precedent for one way we can understand imperial cult. In general it was used to create cohesion and unity throughout the empire (cf. Gordon in Beard and North ed. 1990). Cult practice brought neighbouring communities together in acts of worship; it also cemented their relationship with Rome. As such imperial cult was a tool for empire building. \r\n\r\nThe situation at Rome is even more complex; asking freeborn citizens to worship the emperor, however obliquely, was a delicate process (cf. Price in Bowman, Champlin & Lintott ed. 1996). In 7BC Augustus had reorganised the cults of the 265 districts (âviciâ) of the city; henceforth officials worshiped the Augustan Lares and the emperorâs âgeniusâ at these shrines. Every Roman had a âgeniusâ and the worship of a paterfamiliasâ âgeniusâ is attested; these shrines, therefore, might be more aimed at treating the emperor as a father figure. Indeed, Augustus was eventually granted the title âfather of his countryâ (âpater patriaeâ). Moreover, it seems these shrines were primarily overseen by freedmen and so worship at them was directed not at the political elite. There is also evidence that Augustusâ âgeniusâ was worshipped in private households; again this could be understood as part of envisioning the emperor as a paternal figure and assimilating veneration of him with traditional ancestor worship. For more on these issues see Scheid in Belayche ed. 2001 & Lipka: 2006.\r\n\r\nAfter Augustusâ death in 14AD, the emperor Tiberius was equally guarded in his attitude to cult activities. Augustus was deified after death (as Caesar had been before him). This entitled Tiberius to also style himself a divi filius (son of a god). The key policy was to provide all due honour and respect to Augustus (Tacitus, Ann. 1.15; cf. Cowan: 2009). For living members of the imperial family, and the emperor himself, the situation was more difficult. Tiberius was selective in what honours he would receive and where he would have temples built. For example, though Tiberius accepted a temple to himself (together with the senate and Livia) in Asia, he refused one in Spain; his reason was, apparently, a desire to follow Augustan precedent in accepting some honours, but not to cheapen Augustusâ divinity by allowing widespread sycophantic worship of the current emperor to eclipse reverence for his divinised predecessor (Tacitus, Ann. 4.37). As with Augustus, the cult was still primarily located in the East, and worship of the living emperor was combined with an abstract divinity that signified allegiance to Rome (in this case the senate). It is telling, however, that Tiberiusâ mother Livia was now also involved. We are gradually moving towards a situation where a family, and not exceptional individuals, are being marked out as super-human. \r\n\r\nCultic practice took on a new complexion with Gaius Caligulaâs ascension to the principate (37AD). A young man with apparent mental problems, Caligula marks a turn in the imperial government because he was the first emperor to âinheritâ based on family ties alone. Both Tiberius and Augustus had been great statesmen in their own right; at 25, Caligula had had little experience in government and military affairs. He seems to have been influenced by ideas of Hellenic ruler-cult, and perhaps even Egyptian notions of imperial divinity; sources record that he replaced the heads of the statues of the gods with his own image and sat between the Dioscuri in their temple to be worshipped with them. There is even serious suggestion that he set up his own temple in Rome with priests and a golden cult image of himself (Suetonius, Calig 22; Claud. 9; Dio 59.28.6; cf. Bilde: 1978). Imperial women also gained in influence: Caligulaâs sisters appeared on coins associated with the goddesses Securitas, Fortuna, and Concordia (cf. Wood: 1995). When his sister Drusilla died in 38AD she became the first imperial female to be deified (Dio 59.11). Though accusations of madness and incest make for entertaining anecdotes in our sources, it is hard not to see an attempt on Caligulaâs part to use Hellenic and Egyptian models of ruler-cult to secure his own imperial position. If he had come to power on the basis of his family, it might be beneficial to emphasise the exceptionality of his breeding. The experiment failed, however, and Caligula was assassinated in 41AD.  \r\n\r\nUnder Claudius, the penultimate Julio-Claudian emperor, we see further evolution of imperial cult practice. Governing after Caligulaâs murder in 41AD, Claudius was significantly more cautious than his nephew in all areas. He appears to have reverted to Tiberiusâ practice of bolstering the dead and deified and taking the spotlight off himself. This also helped raise the prestige of the family at the same time and under him Livia, the wife of Augustus, was deified (Suetonius, Claud. 11).  \r\n\r\nAfter his conquest of Britain, Claudius agreed to a massive temple complex to himself at Camulodunum in the province (Tacitus, Ann. 14.31). Britain was a troublesome province and the use of the cult centred around the emperorâs person indicates the way in which the religion aimed to foster unity and adherence to the empire. There is no evidence that Claudius shared this temple with another divinity (cf. Fishwick: 1961): if this is so, it marks a crucial turning point in imperial worship, where the emperor and empire are being collapsed into the same idea. However, in a move similar to Tiberius, Claudius rejected a surfeit of temples. In a surviving letter to the Alexandrians he declines, and expresses his distaste for, a purported temple to himself (despite having such a temple in Britain already). The letter illustrates the difficulties in defining imperial cult practices throughout the empire. However, the information we have implies that successful emperors were cautious in their approach growing the cult slowly and never indulging in excessive honours for themselves.\r\n\r\nImperial cult was a useful weapon for growing allegiance to the empire and imperial family as the provinces expanded and the Julio-Claudian family attempted to retain power. However, it was a double-edged sword: too much self-aggrandisement could pave the way for ridicule and sedition. Thus, though the cult is slippery to pin down it is a fascinating index of the development of imperial power and growth in the period.",

    "description": "Introduction: No other religious group for women in antiquity has the same amount of written and visual evidence than the Vestal Virgins of Rome. The order of the Vestal Virgins belonged to the pontifical college (collegium pontificum) and was one of Rome's largest and most illustrious religious orders that spanned roughly a millennium. Their centrality to Roman religion and the Roman state is demonstrated by the fact that their lodging quarters was located on the Roman Forum itself that was, for most of its history, the civic center of the Roman Republic and Empire until Emperor Theodosius closed the Vestal Order in AD 394.\nEven the antiquity of the Vestal Virgins described in ancient literature demonstrates their importance to Roman culture, and especially the wealth fare of the state. The Vestal order was said to have originated in the times of the legendary king Numa (Cic. Rep.2.64.14; Dion Hal. Ant.Rom. II.64.5-67.1; Ov.Fast.6.357-260; Plut.Num. 9.5), but the very first Vestal Virgin in Roman mythology was Rhea Silvia: the mother of Romulus and Remus (Livy I.4.2; Dion. Hal. Ant.Rom.I.75.1-77.4; Ov.Fast.2.383-86, 3.11), thus, the Vestals Virgins were even older than the city of Rome!\nSelection Process: In order to become a Vestal Virgin, a rigid process overseen by the Pontifex Maximus ensued that scrutinized the girlâs age (no less than six and no more than ten years old), legal status (originally patrician, but later plebeians could enter), and physical condition: her virginity had to be absolute, since this was the most important qualification. An extant description of this process is recorded in Aulus Gelliusâ Atticues Noctes I.12.1-8 in which other physical requisites, such as not having any impairment to hearing or speech, and exemptions are detailed. Though rather young by modern standards, the age of seven in Roman society allowed a girl to participate in both public and private rituals. Furthermore, nearly ninety percent of girls died before the age of six and those that did were more likely to survive into adulthood and fulfill the thirty-year requirement of the Vestal order. Wildfang also postulates that the age of six aided in detecting any physical defects, especially speech impediments. Finally, Wildfang also argues that the limit of the age of ten, is to ensure that a candidateâs virginity is intact before she underwent puberty.\nOnce the candidates passed the requirements, it seems that the Pontifex drew lots in public during the Roman Republic according to the Lex Papia. DiLuzio notes the scholarly debate around the Lex Papia (68 BC) in which the stipulation of drawing lots âe populoâ suggests that, perhaps, at the time, plebein daughters could be candidates for the priesthood. Some evidence suggests that plebein order could participate in the Vestals as far back as 337 BC, where the Vestal Minucia was executed for incestum as Livy (VIII.15.7-8) and scholar RÃ¼pke note.\nTo conclude our remarks on the selection process, it is important to note some changes during the Roman Empire. DiLuzio has shown that in AD 5 Augustus opened-up the Vestal Virgins to the daughters of freedman as well when there was a shortage of candidates. Then, under Tiberius, senators could offer their daughters directly when a vacancy occurred at the death of Occia and, thus, abrogated the 20-candidate necessity.                                                                                                                                                                        \nInitiation Rite: The initiation rite, what is called a âcaptioâ, is also described fully by Gellius (N.A. I.12.13-14). The Pontifex seized the selected candidate by the hand from her father and pronounced the words: sacerdotem Vestalem, quae sacra faciat quae ius siet sacerdotem Vestalem facere pro populo Romano Quiritibus, uti quae optima lege fuit, ita te, Amata, capio (Thus, I take you, Amata, just as she was of perfect law, as a Vestal priestess to do the sacred rites that the law permits the Vestal priestess to do on behalf of the Roman people). Many scholars, such as DiLuzio, Santinelli, and Mary Beard, have noted that the ritual bear a marked similarity to those of a Roman wedding in which the bride is also taken away from the lap of her mother in a simulated abduction. Furthermore, the Vestal dressed her hair in the seni crines (six-tressed) style that was also used by brides in the Roman wedding. As DiLuzio notes, these details a symbolic wedding between the Pontifex and the Vestal virgin. Parting with Beard who sees this rite that marked the Vestal as an interstitial figure, DiLuzio rejoins that it symbolizes the complete transition of the candidate from a private, domestic figure into one in service of the Roman people and state by removing her from her house.  \nDuties: The legal, ritual, and privileges conferred to the Vestal Virgin depended upon her ability to maintain perpetual virginity, a quality that, apart from the Vestal Virgins, was not valued in ancient Roman life generally. DiLuzio notes that this need for perpetual virginity parallels concerns for ritual purity and that in the Roman mind these were one and the same for the Vestal Virgins. Furthermore, their virginity also symbolized the health and welfare of the Roman state. For example, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (IX.40) records a pestilence that affected Rome and, upon investigation, it was discovered that the Vestal Urbinia lost her virginity and was performing public rites. Upon the punishment of Urbinia and the two men, the plague was lifted. \nAnother duty, which is also linked to their chastity, was to perpetuate the fire of Vesta, the goddess of the hearth (perhaps, as far back as the period of Roman monarchy in which Vesta was the goddess of the private, royal hearth) and heart of Rome as Staples and DiLuzio note. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (II.68) recounts that the fire of Vesta went out and a case ensued in which the Vestal Aemlia was tried. In asking for Vesta for aid, Aemlia cast her garment onto the altar and a great fire appeared as if giving proof to Aemeliaâs service and chastity.",

    "description": "Pentecostalism has become a major cultural force in Nigeria since the early twentieth century, accounting for approx. 63% of Nigerian Christians today (World Christian Database). The success of Pentecostalism across Nigeria and Africa more widely has resulted in the widespread absorption of Pentecostal styles of worship into 'mainstream' African Protestant and Catholic churches (the latter known as 'Charismatic' churches). Pentecostals emphasise the active presence of the Holy Spirit both in worship settings and beyond, evidenced in miracles, healings, prophecies, tongues (glossolalia) and other 'gifts of the Spirit'. Nigerian Pentecostals tend to regard their religious faith as a means by which to âbreakâ with their âpaganâ heritage, and becoming born again as a way to be delivered from indigenous African spiritual and cultural life (Meyer 1998). Some Pentecostal churches place a strong emphasis on tithing and material success (âProsperityâ), whilst others are more focused on asceticism and purity ('Holiness'), or healing and exorcism (âDeliveranceâ).\nPentecostalism in Nigeria is widely recognised to have unfolded in three phases. The first phase, known as Aladura, or the African Initiated/Independent Church movement, (1910-1930s) was led by Yoruba itinerant preachers like Joseph Ayo Babalola who clashed with missionaries on the use of medicine (Peel 1968). The Aladura movement, meaning âpraying peopleâ, emphasised prayer, healing and deliverance from traditional 'pagan' religion. In this period, foreign Pentecostal denominations like the Classical Pentecostal church, Assemblies of God, and the Welsh Apostolic church also laid down roots in Nigeria.\nThe second wave, known as the 'Latter Rain' revival, took place in the 1950s and was initiated by British and American evangelists like Sydney Granville Elton and Oral Roberts. This phase emphasised deliverance, healing and also apocalyptic eschatology.\nThe third wave, known as the Neo-Pentecostal movement, emerged in the 1960s-80s and was heavily influenced by ideas and trends introduced to Nigeria in American evangelical literature. Open air revivals, especially on university campuses such as the Universities of Ibadan and Ife, led to an influx of young converts to the movement. Some denominations emphasised Holiness and millennialism (1970s) whilst others propagated the Prosperity Gospel (80s onward). This period saw the emergence of the Nigerian Pentecostal megachurches like Deeper Life Bible Church and the Church of God Mission International. Moreover, since the 1990s, demonology, spiritual warfare and the practice of Deliverance have become increasingly popular features of Nigerian Pentecostalism.",

    "description": "At the beginning of the twentieth century, what is now the country of Mongolia, was a suzerainty of the Qing Empire. The country was divided into different banners ruled by nobles who could claim their legitimacy to their ancestral connections to Chinggis Khan. The nation was essentially feudalist, with noble families connected to temples who were often headed by reincarnation lineages. By 1911, when Mongolia declared independence from the crumbling rule of the Manchurian Dynasty, Buddhist monasteries connected to Tibetan lineages (mostly Gelug) had amassed considerable wealth and power in the preceding centuries. In the 1918 census around 110 000 people were monastics, around half of the adult male population. Around one third of these were celibate living within monastic compounds. The wealth of the temples varied greatly with some, such as the great estate of the Tibetan-born reincarnation the Eighth Javzandamba, ruling over 90 000 disciples. During the erratic beginnings of the twentieth century, Buddhist institutions saw a short-lived consolidation of their power as the Eighth Javzandamba took a position of seniority over the nation from 1911. In 1920, following a series of escalating incursions from the south, a group of revolutionary Mongolians travelled north in search of Russian assistance. In 1921 a group of White Russians, led by the notoriously brutal Russian Baron Ungern-Sternberg, arrived in the capital KhÃ¼ree (now Ulaanbaatar) removing Chinese authorities and re-installing the power of the Eighth Javzandamba. Dismayed by the continued presence of the âMad Baronâ in the country, in July 1921 the group of revolutionary Mongolians returned, backed by the Bolsheviks and entered the capital to oust the Baronâs army. Following the Eighth Javzandambaâs death in 1924, in 1926, the new socialist government began a campaign to undermine the power and influence of the monastic establishments. Initially this campaign was relatively non-violent and set about to decrease the wealth and authority of Buddhist institutions through heavy taxation and education campaigns. From 1929 to 1932 the country saw intensified violence against monasteries, followed by a reprieve when the excessive use of force and the destruction of sacred items caused uprisings and rebellions. Following this period posthumously named âThe Leftish Deviationâ, the government returned to mostly non-violent strategies, encouraging class consciousness among the poorer herders and disciples and increased the taxation of the temples. In 1937 the policies once again turned violent under the rule of prime minister Choibalsan, focusing on campaigns against Buddhist lamas, ethnic Buryats, intellectuals and other sources of opposition. Monasteries were destroyed and looted, lamas forcibly disrobed, and around 13 000 lamas were killed. As Christopher Kalponski writes âIn September 1937, there had been 83,203 lamas in the monasteries. On 25 July 1938, there were 562.â By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country and for the next 50 years the government continued its policy of religious repression. The public practice of religion was outlawed, with only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid, functioning as a showcase for the nationâs religious tolerance.",

    "description": "Marcionism was a branch of early Christian thought often deemed \"gnostic\" or heretical by detractors like Tertullian of Carthage. It is often associated with Marcion of Pontus, a second-century Christian preacher that came to Rome around 144 CE. Marcion is best remembered for his belief that Jesus was the Savior, but was sent by a God other than the one known to readers of Jewish Scripture. Instead of representing the God of Israel, Marcion believed that Jesusâs God was not the God that created the universe, but was a deity that was not known among humans until Jesusâs arrival.\n\nMarcion is best known for his compilation of Christian texts. Marcion read the Gospel of Luke and ten of Paulâs letters, and some scholars have suggested that Marcionâs use of these eleven texts constituted one of our earliest Christian canons. Paul, as apostle to the Gentiles, was understood by Marcion to be one of the few early Christians who understood that Jesus preached a different God than the God of Israel. However, it is unclear of Marcion himself initiated the collection of Paulâs letters that he used, or utilized a collection already in use. The same goes for Marcionâs use of the Gospel of Luke. Some heresiologists argued that Marcion mutilated the Gospel text by removing particular scenes, such as the birth narrative of Jesus. However, it seems likely that Marcion used a version of Lukeâs gospel already in circulation.\n\nEarly heresiologists like Justin, Tertullian, and Epiphanius preserve much of our information about Marcion and Marcionite Christians. However, their work is tinged with polemic and likely does not represent Marcionâs own thought, but rather what other Christians feared about Marcionite treatments of God, Christ, and scripture. They accuse Marcion of extreme asceticism and for treating Jesus as a human upon whom Christ descended, as well as that he divorces Jesusâs teaching from any continuity with Jewish scriptures.",

    "description": "The Drikung Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism is a subsect of the Kagyu school, whose main teachings were passed from Mahasiddha Tilopa (988-1069) to his disciple Mahasiddha Naropa (1016-1100), and from Naropa to the Tibetan master Marpa (1012-1097), who brought the teachings to Tibet. Marpaâs principle student was Jetsun Milarepa (approximately 1040-1123), who passed on the teachings to his students, including Gampopa (1079-1153) from whom the Karma Kagyu, Tselpa Kagyu, Barom Kagyu and Phagdru Kagyu sects were founded. Gampopaâs student Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170) was the teacher of the founder of the Drikung Kagyu sect, Jigten Sumgon (1143-1217). Jigten Sumgon was the grandson of Achi Chokyi Dolma, a great female practitioner who would later come to be a protective deity of the Drikung Kagyu. Jigten Sumgon founded the monastery of Drikung Thil in Central Tibet, which would come to be the center of religious activity for the Drikung Kagyu. The main teachings of the Drikung Kagyu are the Six Yogas/Dharmas of Naropa, the Jewel Ornament to Liberation of Gampopa, the Fivefold Mahamudra (thus named by Phagmo Drupa), the Gongchik of Jigten Sumgon, as well as the biographies and devotional songs of the great Drikung masters (most prominently the 100,000 songs of Milarepa). Up until the 17th century, power was primarily passed hereditarily within the Kyura clan. The Kyura lineage ended with the brothers Gyalwang Konchog Rinchen (1590â1654) and Kunkhyen Rigzin ChÃ¶drak (1595â1659). They were recognized as the 1st Chetsang (older brother) and 1st Chungtsang (younger brother). Both of these positions have passed through reincarnation up until present day. They are now held by Chungtsang Rinpoche Tenzin Chokyi Nangwa (b. 1942), who lives in Tibet, and Chetsang Rinpoche Konchog Tenzin Kunsang Trinley Lhundrup (b. 1946), who lives in India. Although the seat of the Drikung Kagyu is located in Central Tibet, Drikung Kagyu monasteries, retreat centers and dharma organizations have been established all over the world. The Drikung Kagyu enjoy significant influence in the Nangchen region of Kham, as well as in Ladakh and Dehradun (the site of the Drikung Kagyu seat in exile) in India. There are also significant centers in Taiwan, Nepal, Bhutan, the US, Canada, throughout Europe and growing communities in South America and Africa.",

    "description": "The Ghost Dance was a new religious movement founded by a Pauite Indian named Jack Wilson. After experiencing a spiritual vision of a heavenly realm during a solar eclipse on New Years Day of 1889, Wilson began to travel and preach a message of universal love and nonviolence to Indians across the present-day Western United States. Wilson was a spiritual leader among the Northern Paiute (a people who inhabited present-day Nevada) and commonly referred to as \"Wovoka.\" This entry focuses on the practice and religion of the Ghost Dance, but especially on how Wovoka's movement took hold among the Lakota Sioux near the turn of the 20th century. Most historians accept that the persistent practice of the Ghost Dance by the Lakota as one of the most significant factors which lead the US military to attack and murder hundreds of non-combatant Lakota people at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota in the late December of 1890. This event, until relatively recently, was known as the \"Battle of Wounded Knee.\" However, there has been a push in the field to call it what it was: The Wounded Knee Massacre.\n\nThe Ghost Dance itself consists of a traditional circle dance, where many of the participants fell into ecstatic trances and chants. While the ecstatic states and mix-gendered dancing that the ritual entailed grated puritan sensibilities, what made the ceremony threatening to US citizens and military leaders was the ideology and beliefs that lay at the foundations of the dance. Wovoka, as did many spiritual leaders before him of the Paiute, prophesied the return of the dead and the overturning of the current hegemonic [white] order. When the dead returned, they would expel the whites from the land, and traditional indigenous ways of life would return. Death and sickness would cease to exist, and all would reunite with their beloved dead. The Ghost Dance ritual itself was performed to hasten this return of the dead and the overthrowing of oppressive white settlers. Lakota Sioux especially emphasized the upheaval and transformation of the current order in their practice of the religion. Thus, it is easy to see why the method was disconcerting to white onlookers. \n\nHowever, critical to the coming of the dead was the strict adherence to a Christian-like moral code and an unwavering commitment to nonviolence. Wovoka forbade war between tribes and between Indians and the white man. He preached, especially against the practice of rituals which required self-mutilation, warned against lying and stealing, and encouraged all indigenous followers of his Ghost Dance Religion to work hard and earn money through the established systems of the emerging industrial economy. Therefore, while the Ghost Dance Religion was indeed apocalyptic, most scholars believe it primarily functioned to integrate indigenous people into modern society for the sake of Native survival. The thought goes that Wovoka was trying to ensure indigenous flourishing while providing something like a societal pressure valve and release through the apocalyptic hope and practice of the Ghost Dance.",

    "description": "The Zealots were a Jewish sect of the first-century CE that appeared after the Roman occupation of Palestine. They are often characterized by their active resistance to Roman rule. Our primary resource for data concerning the Zealots comes from the Jewish historian, Josephus (War 2.4; 2.13; 2.22; 4.3; Ant. 14.9; 14.15; 16.9; 20.9), who offers a biased presentation of certain radical sectarian movements during the First Jewish Revolt (66-73 CE). For this reason, historical descriptions of the Zealots within Josephus are to be evaluated with caution. Josephus makes reference to a \"fourth philosophy\" that he speaks of with great disdain. In addition to the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, this philosophy is founded by Judas the Galilean or \"of Gaulanitis\" (see also Acts 5:37) and a certain Pharisee named Saddok. This philosophy attracted a great many people, some of whom were young and \"zealous\" (Ant. 18.1). Other characteristics that Josephus ascribes to Judas' movement include a close affiliation with the philosophy of the Pharisees, an interest in freedom, and a belief that only God should be their ruler. \n\nElsewhere, early Christian literature refers to a disciple of Jesus with the titular Simon \"the Zealot\" (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13); however, it is unclear if this terms refers to a religious group, a character trait of Simon (e.g., one who possesses zeal), or a geographical references (Matt 10:4; Mark 3:18). \n\nThe Sicarii are traditionally understood as a more radical and violent subset of the Zealots led by the descendent of Judas, Eleazar (Josephus calls them a \"another sort of robbers\" in War 2.13); however, our sources are not always clear and some have advocated that the two groups be viewed as distinct from each other. The Greek term sikarios is a Latin loan word, meaning assassin, originating in Josephus (War 7.8-11; Ant. 20.9) with a lone reference in the book of Acts (21:38). It appears that the term derives from their weapon of choice, short daggers (see scimitar or sica). According to Josephus, the Sicarii assassinate Jonathan the High Priest and continue on from there to preform \"many\" other \"daily\" murders. The Sicarii are traditionally associated with Masada because of our account in Josephus: they are described as holding the fortress at Masada against the Romans (7.8.2), eventually committing mass suicide at the behest of Eleazar ben Yair; an event that some have described as Josephus' own literary invention. A wealth of archaeological discoveries have been made at Masada, which has lead some to corroborate Josephus' stories with material data (Yadin, Masada [1966]); however, such literal connections have been rightly questioned (see Jodi Magness, Masada: From Jewish Revolt to Modern Myth [2019]).\n\nOne of the challenges in differentiating these groups is the range of terms used in our sources including \"robbers\" (Greek: lÄstai), \"sicarii\"  (Latin: sicarius), \"Galileans\" (see Acts 5:37; Epictetus, Diss. 4.7.6), the \"Barjone\" in rabbinic texts, and the Zealots. Especially outside of Josephus in later rabbinic writings (e.g., Maksh 1.6), these terms appear to take on different meanings. For example, the term Zealot itself has come under scrutiny because the etymology of the semitic term \"zeal\" (qn') possesses a range of meaning outside of Josephus, including one who is zealous for God. With that said, some scholars insist that distinctions are necessary and important, especially considering the more violent descriptions of the Sicarii. Richard Horsley has characterized the Zealots as a group of \"non-violent, if active, resistance\" in stark contrast to the Sicarii (Bandits, Prophets, and Messiahs, 199). In one passage, Josephus appears to make a clear distinction between the Sicarii and Zealots (esp. War 7.8). Nonetheless, our source material is limited in that Josephus is both inconsistent and also shows contempt for both groups.",

    "description": "Ladakhi Buddhism is an inflection of the regionâs inclusion in many political entities, in particular, Tibet in the 7th or 8th centuries. An independent kingdom from the tenth century until 1834, Tibetan Buddhism remains the strongest religious influence, especially in the present-day district of Leh. From the 13th century onwards, Ladakhi kings upheld legitimacy through their roles as protectors of the Buddhist dharma, at one point annexing part of western Tibet; but, territorial acquisition was not sustainable. Political contact with Muslim neighbors increased from the 14th century onward through the 17th century when Mughal emperors asserted power over neighboring Kashmir. Following the Ladakh-Tibet-Mughal War 1679-1684, Ladhaki kingsâ sustained religious allegiance to Tibetan Buddhism; meanwhile, Muslim populations increase coincided with the matrimonial union between the 17th century Buddhist king, âJam-dbyang-rnam-rgyal, and the Muslim ruler of Baltistanâs daughter, RGyal Khatun. Following failed Portuguese Jesuit missionary efforts, British encounters increased only after 1834 when the armies of Zorawar Singh invaded. By 1842, Ladakh lost its independence to Dogra rule. Four years later, it fell under the state of Jammu-Kashmir which acknowledged the authority of British-India. Royal patronage of the monasteries subsided, but monasteries received some support from the state of Jammu-Kashmir and through sustained connections with Tibet. Indian independence in 1947 was met with the complicated uncertainty of the simultaneous partition of India and Pakistan. Following the imposition of a ceasefire line in 1949, Ladakh and Baltistan were cut off, but further wars between India and Pakistan in 1965 and 1972 continued over Jammu-Kashmir territorial disputes. As of October 31, 2019, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir became separate Union Territories where Ladakh remains under direct rule of New Delhi, India.  As of the 2011 census, Tibetan Buddhism is majority religion in Leh, the capital, but a minority religion in Kargil where there is Muslim majority.",

    "description": "The Babylonian Jewish community dates back to the 6th century BCE, with the exile following the destruction of the first temple. Rabbinic Judaism emerges in Roman Palestine following the destruction of the second temple, producing legal and exegetical texts (the Mishna, Tosefta, and Halakhic Midrashim) during the Tannaitic Era. With the close of the Tannaitic era c.220 CE, the Amoraic sages Rav and Shmuel moved to Babylonia and began to teach Rabbinic traditions to the community there.\n\n\nDuring the Amoraic Era (c. 220-500 CE), and the subsequent Saboraic and Gaonic eras, rabbinic teachings were collected and edited into the Babylonian Talmud, a corpus nearly 2 million words long. These traditions encompass a range of genre including biblical interpretation, legal discussions, theology, angels and demons, humor, and history. \n\nJews primarily lived along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This region was home to a diverse population including Christians, Manichaeans, and Zoroastrians (the official Persian religion).\n\nAs a community with roots dating back centuries, Jews in the Sassanian Empire were tolerated and permitted to practice. An official position of \"Exilarch\" was recognized by the Empire. Literary accounts in the Talmud and Gaonic sources speak of persecutions against Jews by the empire in the latter part of this period, although scholars debate their historicity.\n\nThe map covers the region of the major Jewish settlements within Babylonia, not the entirety of the Babylonian empire. The dates examined range from 220-650 CE, corresponding roughly to the dates of the Sassanian Empire and the development of the Babylonian Talmud.",

    "description": "Bhils are a part of a geospatially dispersed tribal community of Western India. They are grouped under the constitutional category of Scheduled Tribes. While Bhili is the main language for the community, Bhils are known to be conversant with a variety of other vernacular languages depending on the region they reside in. Bhils have a rich tradition of orally transmitted religious literature which shares similarities with classical Hindu mythology and yet it is distinct in its own vernacular way. Bhils pay reverence to most popular Hindu gods, rituals, and customs; however, most of the gods and associated practices have hybrid histories with classical myths and practices fluidly blending in with vernacular variants.  \n\n\nThe term Bhil is thought to be derived from the word, Vill, which means bow in Telugu and Kannada. This is keeping in line with their reputation as skilled archers and hunters.  Historically, powerful Bhil kings are thought to have established their own kingdoms in what is present day Gujarat and Rajasthan. It was only through displacement by Rajput and Chalukya rulers of that time that Bhils were made to retreat into forests and hilly regions. Bhils are mentioned in historical records such as Ain-i-Akbari and ancient folk legends such as Kathasaritasagar. Mention of Bhils becomes clearer in the medieval period where their association with Marathas in their fight against the Mughals is well documented. Their knowledge of hilly and jungle terrains made them valuable allies for political powers hoping to control these regions. While some Bhil chiefs decided to assist local political powers, other clan chiefs would resort to resisting these powers often resulting in violent plunders of settled populations. With the influx of British colonialism, the anthropological urge to identify Bhils with primitivity and a prehistorical core of ancient India crystallized Bhil identity as that of Indian aborigines and native inhabitants of India. The British with their military might were more efficient in suppressing raids and plunders by Bhil chiefs. Through diplomatic ties and political manoeuvring, the British were also able to enlist peace treaties with the Bhils and also form Bhil Corps, an integral arm of the colonial law enforcement setup. \n\n\nCertain Indological scholarship and popular belief maintains that Bhils are the descendants of Niá¹£Äda tribes mentioned in the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata. This association can be mainly traced to descriptions of Niá¹£Ädarashtra (the Kingdom of Niá¹£Ädas) as lying between Vindhya and Satpura mountains â the present-day heartland of Bhils. Due to this connection, several characters in the epics such as Eklavya in the Mahabharata and Sabari in Ramayana are thought to be Bhils. A similar historical and communal consciousness, along with issues of socioeconomic marginalization and lack of state assistance for rural development, has led to the development of indigenous political movements. One such movement aims to generate support for the creation of a separate state \"Bhil Pradesh\" to be carved out from specific districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.",

    "description": "This database entry pertains to Roman Catholicism in contemporary Croatia. The geographical area covered corresponds to today's boundaries of the Republic of Croatia and the time period is delimited from 1995 to present-day (2020). Catholics represent the majority of the population in contemporary Croatia and have a very significant influence in the culture and politics of the country. It is widely accepted among scholars of the region that Catholicism is tightly bound together with Croatian ethnicity and national identity.\n\nUndoubtedly, there are continuities between the religious group defined in this entry and other Catholic groups, in particular those in contemporary South and Southeastern Europe. Among these groups, Catholic Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the region of Herzegovina) and some regions of Serbia (e.g. Vojvodina) stand out. These populations largely identify as part of a single ethnic group that shares history and traditions (religious and otherwise) with most of the population of Croatia. Nevertheless, Catholic Croats residing in neighboring countries or those living further afield, sometimes referred to as Croatian diaspora, are not included in this entry. The reason for this is that there are important differences in regard to their relationship to the state, the political status of their religious group and identity, and their interaction with other religious groups within the polity in which they live.\n\nRegarding the similarity between Catholicism in Croatia and elsewhere, there is also a significant degree of coincidence. The Catholic Church in Croatia is in full communion with the Vatican, which means that all dogma, doctrine and cannon law are essentially the same as in the rest of the world. However, particular histories and socio-cultural contexts produce unique features in tradition, practice and even belief in every context, and Croatia is no exception. In this database entry, specific elements and idiosyncrasies that distinguish Croatian Catholicism, such as the importance of pilgrimages, are elaborated in the qualitative notes of the relevant questions.\n\nJust like in the geographical dimension, in the temporal one there is significant continuity between Croatian Catholicism as described in this entry and that of preceding historical periods (e.g. S. XX). This continuity is particularly clear in the domains of religious belief and practice. However, that is not the case in the political, sociological and cultural domains. In this entry, 'contemporary' has been defined as the period from 1995 onward. This year marks the beginning of a peaceful, democratic period in the history of Croatia, existing as an independent nation, that lasts until the present. The period comes immediately after a violent war (1991-1994) where the Republic of Croatia fought against the central  government in Belgrade to gain independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This war is part of what is commonly referred to as the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which led to the eventual disintegration of the SFR of Yugoslavia. The history of this series of armed conflicts is very complex and is outside of the scope of this database. However, it is important to know that the main factions involved are generally defined along ethno-religious lines and that the conflicts were plagued with atrocities committed along these same lines. Therefore, 1995 represents the beginning of the peacetime political order that still prevails in Croatia; an order which is different from the preceding one in regard to, among other things, the status of, and relationships between, different religious groups within the country.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that, in a database entry such as this one, it is impossible to make justice to the richness and diversity of experience, practice, belief and tradition of any religious group and, especially, one with millions of members and a theological tradition of two millennia. The yes/no answers in this entry aim to reflect the most general response to the questions. However, there are cases where such general answers are not possible. This could be because there is no doctrine regarding a specific issue and no general consensus among members of the group, because there is are differences between the doctrine of the Church and widespread beliefs or practices, or simply because the issues are contested even among religious specialists. In general, when there is no obvious consensus answer to a question, this entry favours Church doctrine and teachings, in particular as defined by the Catechism of the Catholic Church. When this is not possible, or when the practices or beliefs of Catholics in Croatia differ overwhelmingly from doctrine, then the popular view is favoured. In these cases, explanations, caveats and further clarifications are included in the qualitative notes.",

    "description": "Fangshi (æ¹å£«) has been variously translated as technicians, masters of methods, recipes or esoterica, even necromancers. Historical records show that they were active through the period of the late Warring States to the Han. It is unlikely, however, that they had a collective identity as such, as scholar Nathan Sivin notes, âfangshi is not a social category but an epithet.â \nNo writings by these men which would represent their voice directly have been left. Instead the Shiji å²è¨ (Records of the Historian), written by Sima Qianå¸é¦¬é· (c.145-c.86 BC) offers the most famous and earliest accounts of the fangshi. Overall described in a negative light, the historian tells us that they were hired to procure drugs of immortalityâthe first emperor of the Qin (r.247-210 BC) had a great desire to become a transcendentâ and promised a way to ascend to Heaven through sacrificial offeringsâthe emperor Wu of the Han (r.140-87 BC) seems to have preferred this. \nTheir origin is obscure. According to the Shiji, they were mostly from the coastal areas of the Qi and Yan states. Evidence of their presence came to light in the invitation of the first emperor of the Qin upon the latterâs imperial tours after the unification. Since then, they rose to prominence at the court of the Han. However, historians and thinkers, especially of the Eastern Han (25-220 CE) were increasingly critical of these men saying that they were just selling empty words. Despite this disapproval, they became widely popular and some were revered as cult figures. From the 2nd century CE, many fangshi were entered in hagiographies of transcendents (xian ä»). \nFor this reason, it seems almost impossible to draw a clear boundary between historical and fictional accounts of these men. This makes it difficult to evaluate their historical importance to religious developments in China. Several questions remain to be answered: how much did their activities overlap with other technical specialists like physicians, astrologers and diviners? Did the yangsheng é¤ç (nurturing life) practicesâdiet, drugs ingestion, gymnastics and breathing cultivation etc.âwidely circulated during the Han originate from the methods of the fangshi? What is the relationship between this group and the transcendents found in early accounts like the Zhuangzi èå­? Though often condemned or mysticized, it might be fairer to say that they occupied an intermediate position between those who strived for transcendence by cultivating their body and those in positions of power who sought immortality by occult recipes. Most significantly, they played a crucial role in shaping Daoist religious traditions of later periods as their methods and lineages were largely incorporated in the techniques and teachings of the Dao (daoshu éè¡/daojiao éæ).",

    "description": "This group is unified by commitment to the inclusion of people with disabilities, rather than by geographical or other doctrinal unanimity. However, this commitment generates similar theological reflection and a shared range of social practices. Disagreement about the nature of inclusion persists; this group is distinguished by consistent participation in a conversation about disability inclusion. This entry will highlight how that conversation impacts these organizations' ritual, theology, and other social practices.\n\nMost of this information is based on unpublished ethnographic research conducted by a team led by the Rev. Dr. Erin Raffety of the Center for Theological Inquiry from May - December of 2019, of which I was a part. Our team of 6 researchers worked with 10 organizations in the NJ-NY-PA area who were intentionally welcoming people with disabilities, with the goal of seeing what worked well and what could be done better. We received IRB approval before starting research from New England IRB. All participants signed consent forms showing their awareness of the research. Notes that lack explicit citation are based on this fieldwork, which will be published under the title, From Inclusion to Leadership: Congregational Ministry with People with Disabilities by Eerdmans Publishing in 2021. \n\nThrough fieldwork, it became clear to me and the rest of our research team that one central question for these organizations concerns integrated vs segregated ministry. Ought churches start new programs to specifically welcome people with various disabilities? Or ought they reform their current programs and services such that people with disabilities can access them more effectively? \n\nAnother prominent theme was reflection on the role of the Church in promoting the life and rights of people with disabilities. What ought churches provide and how can churches best support other non-profit organizations and schools that are already welcoming and supporting people with various kinds of disabilities? \n\nA final theme was the importance of empowering people with disabilities in addition to merely welcoming them. Many churches were eager to discuss different forms this could take, especially with regard to intellectual disability. Some were more reluctant but still open. What does it mean for people with intellectual disabilities in particular to be not just objects of ministry, but subjects? How might churches refine their conceptions of ministry and discipleship in light of this?\n\nIn this entry, I use the terms âpeople with disabilitiesâ and âdisabled peopleâ interchangeably to represent some of the range of ways people with disabilities identify, some preferring person-first language and others not. Our research included people with a variety of physical disabilities (eg. blindness, mobility impairments), intellectual disabilities (Autism Spectrum Disorder, Downâs Syndrome), chronic illness (Crohn's, diabetes), and mental health challenges (depression, Bipolar Disorder).",

    "description": "The Tariqa Shadhiliyya is a Sufi order dating back to the 13th Century CE.  It takes its name from Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili who was born in the Ghumara region of Morocco (1196) and died in Humaythara, Egypt (1258).  Originating in the milieu of the western Islamic world (Andalusia and al-Maghrib), the Shadhiliyya spread through North Africa (via Tunisia) and established a firm foundation in the Middle East as one of the prominent Sufi orders of the medieval and modern Muslim world.  Influences on the al-Shadhili included figures in this western Islamic world such as Abu Madyan (d. 1198), Abd al-Salam b. Mashish (d. 1227), and Ibn Arabi (d. 1240).  It also emerged in the political context of the Almohad revolt against the Almoravids, and therefore the emphasis of the former on the absolute unity of Allah (the principle of tawhid) became a component of al-Shadhiliâs teachings, although it was filtered through Ibn Arabiâs conceptions of wahdat al-wujud (unity of existence).  While influenced by his contemporaries, al-Shadhili saw himself not as merely an inheritor but as the creator of a distinctive path (tariqa).  In the case of al-Shadhili, this path was passed on through specific prayers and formulaic sayings whose repetition is integral to the spiritual development of the disciple (e.g., hizb, dhikr, wird, duâa).  Although these core practices remain present, the attitude of continued reform embodied in al-Shadhiliâs teaching and reflected in the common saying âA Sufi is a child of oneâs timeâ (al-sufi ibn waqtihi) allowed certain figures cast themselves (or are cast by others) as ârenewersâ or âreformers,â and these reform movements continue to give rise to new branches.\n\nIn line with many Sufi orders, the Shadhiliyya serves as a trunk out of which many branches emerge, so it is common to see references to the Shadhiliyya in hyphenated form.  For example, a full lineage of a northern Moroccan branch founded in 2007 would read Fawziyya-Alawiyya-Karkariyya-Darqawiyya-Shadhiliyya while another Egyptian branch is Jazuliyya-Husayniyya-Shadhiliyya.  The Shadhiliyya also has several branches of 'Western Sufism' (or led by western converts to Islam) such as the Murabitun (led by Ian Dallas aka Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Sufi), the Maryamiyya (founded by Fritjof Schuon), and Nuh Ha Mim Keller's Shadhili group in Jordan.  This interaction is not new, however, since its Andalusian spread potentially influenced a few Christian mystics like St. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila.\n\nWhat unites these distinct branches is that they trace their âtariqaâ (literally path or way) back to al-Shadhili through a spiritual lineage (silsila).  The term âtariqaâ has most often been translated as âorder,â often drawing on an analogy between Sufi and monastic orders.  However, rather than referring simply to the social group, tariqa refers to the way of life that leads one to live a pious life and potentially encounter the divine.  This âway of lifeâ consists of an ensemble of exercises performed under the supervision and with the guidance of a master shaykh.  For example, the recitation of prayers (ahzab) attributed to the founder or the performance of poetry from a collective corpus of poems (diwan) from famous Shadhili shaykhs are a major part of what defines a group as Shadhili.  \n\nIn the case of the Shadhiliyya, some of the prominent figures include:\n\n-\tAbu al-Abbas al-Mursi (d. 1271): Considered al-Shadhiliâs successor, al-Mursi was an Andalusian Sufi now considered to be one of the main saints of Egypt.  \n\n-\tAl-Busiri (d. 1294): This Moroccan author of the famous poem âThe Mantleâ (al-Burda) was originally from southern Morocco and studied under al-Mursi in the Shadhili order.\n\n-\tAbu al-Qasim al-Himyari: Known as Ibn al-Sabbagh, he was the author of âThe Pearl of Mysteries and the Gem of Purityâ (Durrat al-Asrar wa tuhfat al-abrar) that contains valuable biographical information about al-Shadhili that details his time in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt, serving as a primary source for subsequent biographical dictionaries (tabaqat).\n\n-\tIbn Ata Allah al-Iskandiri (d. 1309): Credited with consolidating and spreading al-Shadhiliâs teachings, this Egyptian leader of the Shadhiliyya is widely known for his book of aphorisms âal-Hikamâ (The Wisdom) and his autobiographical âLataâif al-minanâ (Subtle Blessings) written in 1298.  This latter work articulates a conception of sainthood connected to an inheritance from and emulation of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n-\tIbn Abbad al-Rundi (d. 1390): Born in Ronda, Spain, he is known for his commentary on Ibn Ata Allahâs aphorisms and for potential influences on Christian mystics in the region.  He is buried in the Bab Ftuh cemetery in Fes, Morocco.\n\n-\tAli b. Muhammad Wafa (d. 1405): This Egyptian Sufi of Mamluk lineage created the Wafaâiyya-Shadhiliyya branch with his father Muhammad, blending a spiritual heritage from al-Shadhili with a local familial authority that allowed the father to compose unique litanies (ahzab) that were spread by his son Ali.  In addition to blending different modalities of sanctity, the Wafaâiyya branch reflects an earlier attempt to integrate the thinking of Ibn Arabi and the Shadhiliyya.\n\n-\tMuhammad al-Jazuli (d. 1465): One of the seven saints of Marrakech, this famous Moroccan Sufi wrote a compilation of prayers on the Prophet Muhammad known in short as âThe Waymarks of Benefitsâ (Dalaâil al-Khayrat).  His renown also made him a significant political figure and as he gained a following, he was expelled and eventually poisoned by a rival politician in 1465.  The Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya became one of the most prominent and influential branches during the medieval period.\n\n-\tAhmad Zarruq (d. 1493): Labeled as a âconservative rebelâ by scholar of Islam Scott Kugle, Zarruq challenged al-Jazuli and his followers for their acceptance of sainthood grounded in popular politics and miraculous deeds.  In contrast, Zarruq presented himself as a âjuridical saint,â deriving his sanctity from his knowledge and practice of Islamic jurisprudence and performing that sanctity through the moral criticism of his surrounding society.  As such, he rebelled against what he saw as moral corruption (due in large part to divergent and exploitative saints) by articulating a conservative, reformed Sufism that placed a greater emphasis on jurisprudence.  He is an important early modern reformist thinker that would serve as a predecessor to later Sufi reform movements.\n\n-\tMuhammad b. Isa (d. 1526): Founder of the Aissawa (Isawa) order known for its music, trance dances, and intricate rhythmic structures, he was a member of the Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya that built his own lodge (zawiya) in Meknes, Morocco.  In Morocco today, they are often hired as musicians for different events, making them both a Sufi order and something like a professional musiciansâ guild.\n\n-\tAbd al-Rahman al-Majdhub (d. 1568): This famous Moroccan poet is known by his nickname âal-Majdhub.â  Literally meaning mad or crazy, majdhub refers to a divinely inspired madness that prevents individuals from functioning properly in ordinary life but allows them to provide insight and blessings or perform miraculous deeds.  Many of his poems are so widespread that they are transmitted not as poems but as proverbs in Morocco.  He was a student in the lineage of Ahmad Zarruq and is said to have founded a Majdhubi-Zarruqi-Shadhili branch that presented a rival vision of sainthood to the popular Jazuli-Shadhili order of the time.\n\n-\tAhmad ibn Ajiba (d. 1809): As an initiate in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, he was a prolific write widely known for his interpretation (tafsir) of the Quran âThe Immense Seaâ (Al-Bahr al-Madid).  \n\n-\tMuhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi (d. 1823): This Moroccan Sufi was a spiritual, political, and military leader.  On the political and military side, he participated in revolts against foreign influences (Ottoman, Spanish, French) and against domestic leaders (Mawlay Sulayman) in the 19th century.  At the same time, many Moroccan elites and members of the Alawi royal family were members of the Darqawiyya.  In the 20th century under the French Protectorate, political expediencies resulted in a mix of confrontation and collaboration with French and Spanish authorities.  As a spiritual leader, al-Darqawi is best known through his letters and is recognized as a ârenewerâ that gave rise to multiple branches.\n\n-\tAhmad b. Idris (d. 1837): Of Moroccan origin, although he did not formally establish his own order, this prolific figure had a tremendous influence on several modern Sufi reform movements (often glossed as neo-Sufi orders).  Three of these influences include (1) Muhammad b. Ali al-Sanusi (d. 1859) â founder of the Sanusiyya order that resisted French colonialism in Libya â(2) Muhammad Uthman al-Mirghani (d. 1852) â founder of the Khatmiyya/Mirghaniyya in Sudan that would later become central to Sudanese politics â and (3) Abd al-Rahman al-Duwayhi al-Rashid (d. 1874) â founder of the Ahmadiyya-Rashidiyya branch that would spread through East Africa, the Middle East, northern India, and southeast Asia.  His teachings included an emphasis on Islamic jurisprudence and the renewal of independent legal reasoning (ijtihad) as a way to overcome the stagnation of legal thinking and blind adherence (taqlid), as well as a spiritual doctrine of the Muhammadan Way (tariqa Muhammadiyya) that sought both the emulation of the Prophetic model (sunna) and encounter with the Prophet Muhammad in a conscious state. \n\n-\tAbd al-Rahman al-Fasi (d. 1878): Initiated in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, al-Fasi founded the Fasiyya branch in 1850 originally in Libya and later in Mecca with lodges in Yemen, Syria, and Egypt as well.  His most famous disciple was Abd al-Qadir al-Jizairi (d. 1883) who led a resistance movement against the French in Algeria and was eventually exiled to Damascus where he established a circle of followers under the spiritual patronage of al-Fasi.  This circle would be an important element in the development of modern Salafi thought.\n\n-\tAhmad al-Alawi (d. 1933): Born in Mostaghanem, Algeria, Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi (born Ahmad b. Aliywa) founded the Alawi branch of the Darqawi-Shadhili in 1914.  While working in a variety of modern fields to encourage the integration of European and Islamic ideas Shaykh Alawi had a significant influence on several European thinkers (e.g., Guenon).  He is considered a ârenewerâ of the Shadhili for his redeployment of the spiritual retreat (khalwa) with a specific articulation (talqin) of the name Allah as a primary practice for disciples.  Currently, the Alawiyya is headed by Shaykh Khalid b. Tunis and has membership throughout Europe and North Africa.",

    "description": "Ganden Monastery was established in 1409 by Tsongkhapa Losang Drakpa (1357-1419), the founder of the Geluk tradition. At an altitude roughly 4075 meters above sea level, it is located some forty kilometers northeast of the city of Lhasa in the province of Ã in Central Tibet (today, the Chinese DagzÃª District). Its full name is Drok RiwochÃ© Ganden Nampar GyelwÃ© Ling, although it is also called Geden in accord with prophecies connecting its name to the syllable gÃ©. Tibetan sources state that the term Geluk arose from the name Geden, with those at this monastery known as âupholders of the tradition of Gedenâ (dge ldan ring lugs âdzin pa). \n\nAccording to one prophecy, the monastery was conferred the name Ganden due to a prophecy that Tsongkhapa would be reborn in Tuá¹£ita in his next life. Prophecies related to Ganden make up a major part of Tibetan historical accounts of the monastery, and describe elements such as its founder, location, certain sacred objects related to Ganden, and the qualities of its early hierarchs and their disciples. On a mundane level, Ganden was founded out of the consternation Tsongkhapaâs disciples had for their itinerant lifestyle, as well as concerns for Tsongkhapaâs well-being as he aged. \n\nDrok Ri or Nomad Mountain was chosen as the site of Ganden in accord with prophesies and divinations. It possesses numerous geomantic elements marking it as an auspicious abode; in particular, Ganden is famed for the presence of âself-arisenâ forms, spontaneous natural phenomena that embody or evoke supernatural phenomena, as well as objects and events from the lives of Tsongkhapa and other influential figures. Situated along the circumambulation routes surrounding Ganden, these phenomena, along with Gandenâs major festivals, represent two of the monasteryâs main attractions for lay devotees. \n\nDuring its phase of initial construction, Ganden consisted of a residence for Tsongkhapa, a general assembly-hall with a shrine, and living quarters for about seventy monks, with the foundations laid for one hundred more. Later, more structures were added, including Yangpachen Temple, a temple for Tsongkhapa's reliquary stupa, and buildings for the two main colleges of Ganden, JangtsÃ© and ShartsÃ©. Also present are retreat-huts that belonged to Tsongkhapa and Khedrub JÃ©, and a printing house. All these structures contain numerous religious objects and murals. Perhaps the most sacred item is Tsongkhapaâs own reliquary stupa, which continues to attract devotees to the present day.",

Associated with the emergence of Latin American liberation theology, CEBs of the late 1960s began as community formation projects led by missionary nuns and priests in poor communities. Their model and method took inspiration from Paulo Freireâs Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), the Second Vatical Council (1962 â 1965), from early Catholic Action programs, and from the social and political critiques that emerged among liberation movements across the region following the Cuban Revolution. Throughout the 1970s, CEBs became increasingly lay-led and developed into a powerful religious and political social movement. As such, while CEBs often formed larger regional or national organizations to facilitate communication and political mobilization, this movement was broadly grassroots, disaggregated, and pluralistic in theology, practice, and sense of purpose. Despite their significant diversity, Latin American CEBs shared common tendencies such as: lay leadership and greater lay participation in liturgical life, small community worship and organization, an emphasis on gender parity, a commitment to grassroots politics, a Marxist and liberation theology-informed social critique, and a spiritual educational model rooted in lay analysis of scripture applied to present, worldly concerns. CEBs continue to exist in many Latin American countries, though their prevalence and social influence declined markedly after the mid-1990s in most places.",

    "description": "âSino-Christian Theologyâ designates an academic, cultural, and theological movement that began in mainland China during the 1980âs, and that later developed in other Sinophone areas like Hong Kong and (to a lesser extent) Taiwan. Distinct from the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), and the substantial evangelical, charismatic, and Neo-Calvinist movements, it represents a small, possibly waning, but altogether unique expression of Christianity in postsocialist China.  Â¶  The term âSino-Christian Theologyâ translates hanyu jidu shenxue, which literally means âHan-language Christian theology.â Most commonly, it refers to an intellectual wave inaugurated by the work of Liu Xiaofeng and He Guanghu, both professors at Renmin University who have since become quasi-canonized as its âchurch fathers.â While the movement has diversified over its decades-long development, three broad features remain. Sino-Christian Theology: is written in Chinese; emphasizes the contemporary situation; and prioritizes universities (rather than churches or seminaries) as the primary site for knowledge production.  Â¶  Conventionally, Sino-Christian Theologians tend to be âCultural Christiansâ (wenhua jidutu), i.e. Christians who do not profess âpersonal faithâ in Christianity or who are not regular, church-going attendees. As far as the Chinese public and even most scholars are concerned, Sino-Christian Theology and Chinese Cultural Christianity are virtually synonymous. âChinaâs Apollos,â âChinaâs Nicodemus,â and âScholars in Mainland China Studying Christianityâ (SMSC) are other appellations that have been used to describe the movement.  Â¶  Sino-Christian Theologians have tended to approach theology from within the disciplines of literature, philosophy, and various social sciences. Yang Huilin sees the movement as closer to Religious Studies than Theology (as conceived in the West), while Chloe Starr observes that Sino-Christian Theology constitutes a âtheorizing of theology itself.â  Â¶  There are three primary contexts in which Sino-Christian Theology has arisen. The first, as Fredrik Fallman observes, concerns the broader Chinese quest for modernity. Since Chinaâs humiliating defeats by foreign imperialists during the so-called âCentury of Humiliationâ, Chinese intellectuals have labored to reform China and re-negotiate its place in the new global world order. Not unlike Republican-era Christians like Wu Leichuan and Zhao Zichen, Sino-Christian Theologians turn to Christian resources to address Chinaâs ongoing aspirations to modernize. The second, following Starr, locates the movement within larger globalizing trends of the world-wide church. Alongside Black American, Korean Minjung, and various postcolonial theologies, Sino-Christian Theology represents the continuing Chinese attempt to forge a Christianity that does dialogical, liberational justice to contextual sociocultural realities. The post-Mao Reform Era constitutes the third context. The movement arose due to the relaxation of restrictions in virtually all spheres of life, whether economic, political, or religious.

    "description": "The Church of England is the established church of the nation of England and has its origin in Henry VIII's break from Rome in 1534. The so-called 'Elizabethan Settlement' was an attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to find a via media between the radical Protestantism of the Puritan movement and the excesses of Roman Catholicism. As such, under Queen Elizabeth, the Church of England established its identity as Reformed and Catholic: 'Reformed' in the sense that it identified its theological authority not primarily in the traditions of the Church but in Scripture, and 'Catholic' in the sense that it retained such Catholic traits as an emphasis upon the apostolic succession of bishops, the sacramental identity of the Church, a formal liturgical character, and the Church's continuity with the Medieval and Patristic past.\nIn the modern period (here demarcated as beginning in 1963 with the publication of the significant work of liberal theology 'Honest to God', by the then Bishop of Woolwich John Robinson), the Church of England's identity and sources of authority are contested. Although its sources of doctrine and practice are still formally codified in Canon Law as deriving from Scripture and its historical formularies - the Book of Common Prayer, the 1662 Ordinal, and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion - there is wide divergence of opinion as to how this is to be understood.\nThe current 'parties' in the Church of England can be divided into three: Evangelical, Catholic and Liberal. Evangelicals emphasize the Reformed heritage of the Church of England and note the authority of Scripture. Catholics stress the importance of the Church's sacraments, its links to the Medieval and Patristic past, and its relationship with other episcopally led churches such as the Roman Catholic Church. Liberals highlight the role of reason in the interpretation of Scripture and the historic formularies. The existence of these different 'traditions' within the Church of England results in a sense of its contested identity: doctrine, belief and practice often vary dramatically from church to church. Its unifying feature must be said therefore to be the institutional structure focussed on the ecclesiastical hierarchy - archbishops, bishops, priests etc. - and the centralized and diocesan adminstrations which oversee parishes and other institutions within the Church.",

Nicole Volmering is a postdoctoral researcher specialising in the medieval religious literature and history of the insular world. Her research interests include monasticism, eschatology, martyrologies, and the history of the book. She holds a PhD in Early and Medieval Irish from University College Cork, which won the Johann Kaspar ZeuÃ prize, as well as a MA in English (track Old English). She is editor of the forthcoming Martyrologies in the Insular World. Context: The âBritish Islesâ in this document refers primarily to the area of Great Britain south of Hadrianâs wall.\nNote: The gradual Christianization of Britain in this period was not a homogeneous or coherent process. The British Church appears to have a well-integrated provincial hierarchy in the fourth century: our earliest documentary evidence is the presence of British bishops at the Council of Arles in 314 CE. Yet its continuation is shadowy until the sixth century. Christianity retained a stronger foothold in the Western and some northern parts, while it may have declined in the East under pressure of Germanic raids and settlements by the end of the period. Just across the northern border however the Picts also appear to adopted (and abandoned) Christianity, while St Patrick brought it across the water to Ireland. The âre-conversionsâ of Anglo-Saxon peoples belong to the sixth century.",

    "description": "The Pharisees are an early Jewish sect dating from the late Hellenistic period to the end of the first century CE. Our primary evidence for this group derives from the Jewish historian Josephus (d. ca 100 CE), early Christian literature, and the later Tannaitic literature. According to Josephus (War 2.8; Ant. 13.5.9; 13.10.6; 18.1.2-6), the Pharisees are one of three \"philosophical sects\" of the Jews, who \"are friendly to one another, and are for the exercise of concord, and regard for the public\" (War 2.8.14; trans. Whiston). The group appears to have formed sometime during the Hasmonean period (ca. 140 BCE) as an influential party among a majority of the Jewish people. As a political entity, they appear to have gained popularity in response to the Sadducees and the Hasmonean High Priest John Hyrcanus, securing political leverage under Salome Alexandra. \n\nThe Gospel sources offer a polemical portrayal of the Pharisees at odds with the early Jesus movement (Matthew 23:1-39), often engaging in ritualistic dispute with Jesus and his disciples (Mark 7:1-23). In other early Christian sources, the apostle Paul identifies himself with the Pharisees (Acts 22:3; 23:6; Philippians 3:5; Galatians 1:14), and elsewhere, is depicted as actively persecuting members of the early Jesus movement (Acts 8:1-3). In these sources, a positive portrayal of the Pharisees may be found in the figure of Gamaliel (Acts 5:34-42), who persuades the Sanhedrin to show mercy to followers of Jesus. \n\nThe term Pharisee may derive from the Hebrew word \"to separate\" (perushim); however, this etymology has been recently questioned (Rivkin, \"Who Were the Pharisees?\"). The sectarian boundaries of the Pharisees were determined by a commitment to food and purity rituals laid out in Oral (e.g., \"tradition of the fathers\") and Written (e.g., the Torah) traditions. Their belief system consists of monotheism, an afterlife (of both reward and punishment), the immortality of the soul (especially in contrast to the Sadducees), and resurrection for the righteous. In the literary evidence, Pharisees are often characterized as the leading experts in interpreting the law and, according to Josephus, less stringent in rendering punitive judgement than the Sadducees.",

    "description": "Nahdlatul Ulama is an Islamic mass organization in Indonesia. The organization was founded in 1926 by Hasyim Asyari in Surabaya, East Java, in response to the increasing presence of modernist Islam in the Dutch East Indies and the institutional force of Muhammadiyah, a modernist Islamic mass organization. The stated goal of the organization was to defend the interests and values of the scholars of traditionalist Sunni Islam, Ash'ari theology, and the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. \n\nAlthough the organization has a central leadership, there are many additional centers of authority underneath this top level, including provincial and regional branches and autonomous affiliated organizations for certain groups (e.g. women, youth, students). The beating heart of the organization is the network of traditionalist Islamic schools called (pesantren), where the future leaders and scholars of the organization are educated. Through the extensive pesantren network, the organization is able to reach and recruit constituents in a widely dispersed geographic area. The kyai or leaders of these pesantren are furthermore authoritative figures in their respective communities that exceeds the education of youth. \n\nThe organization has undergone multiple shifts in its almost century-long history. During the last years of Dutch colonial rule and the Japanese occupation (1942-45), Nahdlatul Ulama became politically active. After independence, Nahdlatul Ulama and the modernist Islamic mass organization Muhammadiyah worked together in a political party, Masyumi, representing the interests of Indonesian Muslims; but due to internal conflicts, Nahdlatul Ulama withdrew from Masyumi in 1952 and founded their own political party. The organization remained active in party politics until 1984. Since this time, it has not been directly involved in party politics. \n\nSince the fall of the New Order in 1998, Nahdlatul Ulama has taken an active role in the formation in what they consider a tolerant, civil, and moderate Islam. In 1999, the renowned former chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Abdurrahman Wahid (more commonly known as Gus Dur) became the first democratically elected president of Reformation Era Indonesia. While his tenure as president was only two years long, his vision for the organization and the relation between the country and Islam continues to shape the organization until today. Gus Dur is held up as a hallmark of a friendly, accommodating, and tolerant Islam. Since 2015, this vision of a moderate Islam has become known within Nahdlatul Ulama as âIslam Nusantara,â the Islam of the Indonesian world, a term which points to the organizationâs commitment to embracing local culture, to coexisting peacefully with others, and to being an bulwark against radical Islamic influence.",

The Rastafari movement comprises a syncretic belief system combing Judeo-Christian tradition and imagery, African derived Jamaican peasant culture and spirituality, and a fierce political opposition to oppression and separation in favour of love and unity.  \n\nVariation of practices, specific beliefs and spiritual influences, understood within Rastafari as âlivityâ, are broad within a movement which is deeply anti-hierarchical and which has no central spiritually authoritative body. The movement is however orientated around attestation to the divine, divinely inspired or personally inspirational nature of His Imperial Majesty (HIM) Haile Selassie I (pre-regnal name Ras Tafari), Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930-1974. Largely a monotheistic movement, adherents refer to the divine creator (sometimes interpreted as HIM) as âJahâ, an interpreted rendering of âJehovahâ. \n\nHaile Selassie became a figure of anti-colonial resistance and black assertiveness in colonised communities across the world after his coronation in 1930 which some saw as fulfilment of prophecy foretold by black nationalist Marcus Garvey of a black king who would lead black populations out of oppression and towards glory. Garvey himself built much of his rhetoric of black self-determination around Biblical sentiments, particularly Biblical allusions to 'Ethiopia' (esp. Psalms 68:31) which was interpreted broadly to refer to Africa as a whole. Ethiopia had also gained a reputation as the only non-colonised sovereign state on the continent of Africa having previously defeated Italian imperialists (most significantly at the Battle of Adowa 1896, a date commemorated by Rastafari annually). Haile Selassie then came to embody an anti-imperialist and anti-oppressive struggle many in the Caribbean were experiencing, and become the central focus of a new movement. This led many in the movement both in itâs formation and today to yearn towards a repatriation to the âmotherlandâ of Africa, or more specifically for some to Ethiopia and to Shashamane where Haile Selassie donated land for the repatriative efforts of those in the diaspora. \n\nThe notions here of resistance to oppression and injustice underpin Rastafari cosmologies and interactions with the world today. Rastafari frequently denounce the wickedness of âBabylonâ in contrast to âZionâ. âBabylonâ offers an interpretation of the industrial, colonial and post- colonial, Western reality as a subjugation of humanity in an existence defined by oppression and suffering. Conversely, the most divine locality of Zion represents a beacon of hope, freedom and a physical and spiritual repatriation to the place of The Almighty.\n\nAn equally core element of Rastafari belief is an emphasis on the natural and the primordial in recognition that that which is most natural on this earth is most in accord with Jahâs original design for creation.

    "description": "Gaengjeongyudo is a Korean new religion founded by Kang Daeseong in during the colonial period. Kang, whose religious name is Yeongsindang, was born in 1890 in North Jeolla province. After years of spiritual practice which was also accompanied by his wife and son, Yeongsindang attained a form of spiritual awakening, or enlightment, after which he began to display supernatural and prophetic abilities, and gain disciples. The object of faith in Gaengjeongyudo is an astrological diagram called Seondanggung, which is composed of elements such as the East and the West, the Yin and the Yang, and 24 seasons and periods. At the core of Gaengjeongyudoâs tenets is the notion that the three traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and âSeonâ (native Korean belief of spirituality and heaven) should be harmonised. It is believed that we are currently living through a time of great change in the universal order, and the questions and answers concerning the future vision are contained in detail in Bueunggyeong, the core scripture written by the founder himself. Followers of Gaengjeongyudo are best known for their traditionalist way of living, and although the membership has significantly declined over the years, many of the followers still reside in Cheonghakdong, maintaining their distinctive lifestyle. Although Gaengjeongyudo is often categorised as a Confucianism-based new religious movement due to the name and distinct traditionalist outlook, such classification is highly disputable. While elements of Confucianism can be found especially from the adherence to Confucian virtues such as loyalty and filial piety, incorporation of Confucian elements in varying extent is in fact a very common characteristic to most native Korean new religions of syncretic nature. Based on the unique scriptures, religious symbols and distinct objects of faith, Gaengjeongyudo is distinguished from Confucianism-based movements such as Daedonggyo and Gonggyo, which placed great emphasis on classical Confucian texts and philosophy.",

    "description": "SannÅ shintÅ refers to narratives, doctrinal analyses and artistic depictions related to the âmountain sovereignsâ (jp. SannÅ), the deities of the Hie shrine, now Hiyoshi taisha, in Sakamoto at the foothills of Mount Hiei. \nIn SannÅ shintÅ, the identity of the Hie deities is chiefly conceptualised with the vocabulary and semiotic framework of Tendai Buddhism, and in special (but not exclusive) relation to the lineages residing at the Enryakuji on Mount Hiei, to this day the main Tendai centre in Japan. While the first extant sources relating the Hie deities to the Enryakuji date back to the ninth century, SannÅ shintÅ reached its apex as a discourse in the middle ages (12th-15th century), throughout which the majority of the material extensively treating the identities of the deities was collected.\nMore concretely, SannÅ shintÅ can be defined in two ways. In a narrow sense, it only indicates discourses produced at the Enryakuji, mostly mythological and doctrinal, which establish correspondences between the deities of Hie and specific Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Although SannÅ is a collective term for the whole host of deities enshrined in the twenty-one shrines of Hie, most often the âmountain sovereignsâ are three of them: Åmiya, presiding over the western compound of the shrines; Ninomiya, presiding over the eastern, and ShÅshinji, also a deity of the western compound. In the âstrictâ definition of SannÅ shintÅ, these are considered as emanations of, or identical to, three Buddhas: ÅÄkyamuni, the main Buddha of the Western pagoda area of the Enryakuji (saitÅ), Yakushi (sskr. Bhaiá¹£ajyaguru), presiding over the Konpon chudo in the Eastern pagoda area, and Amida (sskr. Amitabha), presiding over the Yokawa area. Such correspondences are sanctioned by monastic treatises such as the KeiranshÅ«yÅshÅ« (14th century).\nAt a broader level, however, we can say that SannÅ shintÅ is also made up of discourses on the deities of Hie that do not quite befit the narrow interpretation. For instance, these might be mythological accounts produced at the Hie shrine, touching upon subjects such as the origin and enshrinement of the deities; accounts of the festival held each year for the deities, as well as monastic discourses which do not quite conceptualise the deities within the same correspondences of the narrow definition. In this entry I shall adopt the broader definition for three reasons. Firstly, because the medieval Hie shrines and Enryakuji were closely intertwined from an institutional point of view. Secondly, because the correspondences of the narrow definition do not represent the full extent of the diachronic evolution of SannÅ shintÅ. Thirdly, because the ânarrowâ definition of SannÅ shintÅ presupposes the âbroaderâ one, especially from a mythological perspective. Thirdly, because textual material that presents the correspondences of the ânarrowâ version of SannÅ shintÅ often also includes accounts produced not by monastics, but by priestly lineages at the shrines. Such is the case for two of the the texts which are considered synonymous with SannÅ shintÅ, YÅtenki (13-15th century) and Sange YÅryakki (13th century).\nTaking account of this, in consulting this entry one should keep in mind at all times that SannÅ shintÅ was not a conscious religious group, but a discursive field comprising various mythologies, ritual and devotional aspects, all joined together by being centred on the same deities and the same place. \nPlease note that this article focuses on the medieval discourse on the Hie deities, but not on SannÅ ichijutsu shintÅ, the pre-modern discourse issued from SannÅ shintÅ but focused on the TÅshÅgÅ«, in Nikko.",

    "description": "The UFMCC (often shortened to âMCCâ) is a Christian denomination that was founded first and foremost as a ministry for LGBTQ people. Reverend Troy Perry, who grew up in rural Florida and worked as a pastor in Baptist and Pentecostal churches before coming out as gay, launched the initial congregation in his Los Angeles living room in 1968. When the denomination was officially established in 1970, there were a handful of congregations, spanning several states. By 1972, there were 35 congregations in 19 states. Today, the MCC consists of over 200 congregations in over 30 countries around the world (although this entry focuses on the U.S. and Canada).\n\nPerry served as Moderator (the denominationâs head) until 2005, and since then there have been three Moderators. Rev. Elder Cecilia Eggleston was elected Moderator in 2019. Every three years, all MCC ministers and selected members gather for General Conference, where the Moderator and the Governing Board (administrative leadership) are elected.\n\nIndividual congregations maintain a great deal of autonomy over their worship practices, and thus there is a wide variety of worship styles in the MCC. Many churches blend charismatic and more formal influences. One of the few denomination-wide requirements for worship is that every congregation offer Holy Communion at weekly services.\n\nThe theologically diverse denomination defies easy labels of \"conservative\" and âliberal.â For decades, the denominationâs doctrinal statements proudly proclaimed that the MCC âmoved in the mainstream of Christianity,â which they defined by the Apostlesâ and Nicene creeds. Additionally, these doctrinal statements made what most would deem to be orthodox Protestant affirmations, such as âAll men are justified to God through Faithâ and âthe Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God.â \n\nIn the twenty-first century, however, the denomination's official proclamations of doctrine have become less insistently âorthodox.â Even as the personal theologies of many MCC ministers and members continue to resemble âorthodox Protestantâ beliefs, the denominationâs Statement of Faith now includes proclamations like âWe don't all believe exactly the same thingsâ and âWe are part of an ongoing conversation on matters of belief and faith, shaped by scripture and the historic creedsâ (with no attendant declaration of the scriptureâs divine inspiration). \n\nIf there is one unifying theological theme across the MCC, from its inception to the present, it is the belief that support for LGBTQ equality is an outgrowth of authentic Christian faith, which is âgrounded in God's radically inclusive love for all peopleâ (as the current Statement of Faith puts it). In recent years, what began as the churchâs focus on equality for âhomosexualsâ has expanded, at least in many of the denominationâs circles, to include a focus on social justice issues more broadly.",

    "description": "Sethian gnostics â also referred to by scholars as âclassic gnosticsâ or simply âthe gnosticsâ â represent a sect within early Christianity that existed from the second through the fourth century CE. Most of what we know about this group derives from the discovery of the Nag Hammadi collection of Coptic manuscripts, which dates to around 350 CE, but this information is supplemented by various heresiological writings by early proto-orthodox theologians, most significantly Irenaeus, who wrote around 180 CE. The name Sethian is applied to the sect by modern scholars because of its self-identification with the biblical Seth, son of Adam. âGnosticsâ comes from the Greek word gnÅstikoi (roughly, âthose who knowâ), which some scholars consider to be a label the Sethians applied to themselves.\n\nSocial information about the Sethians must be inferred from the textual evidence, which contains a number of features used to characterize them: (1) a complex cosmogonic myth based in part on a creative revision of Genesis and Platoâs Timaeus, (2) a strong sense of group identity and in-group language as the âseed (or offspring) of Seth,â and (3) a ritual of baptism sometimes called a ritual of âfive seals.â Very little is known of the daily life or organizational structure of the Sethians. They shared with other Christians certain theological traditions, some scripture, and an ascetic lifestyle.\n\nSome features of the Sethian myth include: (1) an ineffable divine first principle called the Parent or Invisible Spirit; (2) a second principle called Barbelo; (3) a series of four luminaries, also called aeons or realms, named Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithai, and Eleleth; (4) the emanation of a number of additional aeons, the last of which is named Wisdom (Sophia in Greek); (5) a craftsman (dÄmiourgos in Greek) named Ialdabaoth, who steals divine power from his mother (Wisdom) to create the visible cosmos based on intelligible paradigms while remaining ignorant of the divinities higher than him; (6) the creation of seven, twelve, and/or 365 rulers of the material world who themselves create human beings and the remainder of the material world; (7) a dramatic struggle resulting in some of humanity being given Ialdabaothâs pilfered power as a spark of divinity; (8) these human beings are the offspring of Seth, sealed by a special baptismal ritual, while the offspring of Cain remain under the power of the ignorant demiurge and his minions. (9) Where the human Jesus appears in the versions of this myth, he is variously identified with a preexistent Anointed One (Greek christos), a preexistent Word (Greek logos), a preexistent Seth, or Barbelo.\nIndividual Sethian texts contain some but not all of the elements of this myth. As such, the category âSethian Gnosticâ can be understood as a polythetic class, i.e. it contains a number of non-essential characteristics but lacks an essential (sine qua non) characteristic. Some scholars, notably John D. Turner, have reconstructed a âliterary historyâ of these texts based on textual developments within this mythic framework. The complex emanation scheme of the Sethian myth reveals an involvement with the Middle Platonic philosophical speculation of the time, which has been compared to such thinkers as Philo of Alexandria and Numenius of Apamea.",

    "description": "For the first six decades of the 20th Century, Pentecostalism was viewed with skepticism and often outright dismissed by other denominations of Christianity. Many Christians believed Pentecostals to chaotic and disorderly. Pentecostal practices of speaking in tongues, their beliefs in divine healing and prophecy, and their unorganized and noisy prayer gatherings ostracized them from other established Protestant traditions believed to be more orderly and respectable. They were seen as a fringe group that stood outside of the traditions of mainline and evangelical branches of the larger Protestant community.  \n\nHowever, Pentecostalism and a majority of the Christian communities in the United States would undergo a massive shift as Pentecostal theology and practices burst into the âorderlyâ worlds of mainline denominations and swept across denominational boundaries beginning in 1960.  In a small Episcopalian perish in Van Nuys, CA in April 1960, the charismatic renewal found its genesis when Reverend Dennis Bennett shared his experience of being baptized in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. His announcement angered his congregation and he was asked to resign shortly after sharing his experiences. \n\nDespite the parishioners of St. Markâs Episcopal Church being told to not speak about what Reverend Bennett shared about, one parishioner was not going to be quiet. Jean Stone was a parishioner who began a media campaign to chronicle and share about Reverend Bennettâs experience.  Stone got Time Magazine and Newsweek to write articles about the renewal movement and Bennett became the defacto face of the Charismatic Renewal movement in the United States. As Bennettâs story spread throughout the country, other clergy from mainline Protestant denominations began to share about their experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Methodists, Lutherans, Baptists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Mennonites, Roman Catholics, and others began to open up about their Pentecostal experience and many began to practice speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing, and deliverance.\n\nAlthough there is an overlap between some of the beliefs between Pentecostals and Charismatics, there are some key differences. Both groups believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is an experience that often takes place after conversion (although some adherents experience the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at their conversion). A key difference is the evidence of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals believe that a person must speak in tongues in order to demonstrate that they have been baptized in the Spirit. Charismatics claim that although many people do speak in tongues as their first sign, it is not the only sign that accompanies being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Any manifestations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit outlined in the New Testament are recognized by Charismatics as being baptized in the Spirit.  \n\nThe Charismatic Renewal Movement validated Historical Pentecostal churches and movements as part of the American Christian landscape. Prior to the movement, Mainline and Protestant denominations viewed Pentecostalism with disdain and were weary of their theology and practices. However, the media coverage of Reverend Dennis Bennettâs experiences in California in 1960, as well as the rise in denominational clergy sharing about their own experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit, led mainline denominational leaders were to address the Charismatic renewal movements taking place in their churches.  Most of these denominations ultimately accepted Charismatic adherents as part of their tradition. Other denominations left their position on the charismatic renewal movement open without rejecting the movement outright.",

    "description": "Peruvian Mormons identify as members of the largest sect of Mormonism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They identify as Peruvian either because they were born in Peru or because one or more of their parents or grandparents were. Peru is a highly diasporic nation, and though most Peruvian Mormons live in Peru, many live in the U.S. state of Utah where their church is headquartered. There may be Peruvians who identify as members of sects of Mormonism other than The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, however, none of the participants in the principal anthropological study from whence this data set emerges identify with these sects nor do they know of any Peruvians who do. Importantly, most Peruvian Mormons do not identify as âPeruvian Mormons.â This is partially because their church, on August 16, 2018, expressly directed its membership to eschew the âMormonâ moniker from self-identification, but mostly because the general membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints desires to be seen as a global fellowship, not as a set of nationally situated religions with local, syncretic practices. Designating Mormons who happen to also be Peruvian, âPeruvian Mormonsâ is part of a theoretical intervention that separates the Mormonism happening among Peruvian Mormons in Peru and Utah from the sorts of Mormonism happening among the people Peruvians call \"Anglos\" in order to highlight the unique challenges Peruvians face in navigating a decidedly non-Peruvian organization that was founded upon early colonial U.S. (Anglo) conceptions of race and kinship.",

    "description": "Christian monastic communities of strict observance, characterised by Sabbatarianism, concerns for ritual purity, constant spiritual surveillance, and a strong sense of in-group distinctiveness in the face of other laxer communities. In general, the term refers to communities influenced by the teachings of saint MÃ¡el Ruain, abbot of Tallaght, Co. Dublin (obit 792). From Tallaght, four written sources are extant: the Old Irish Penitential, the Martyrology of Tallaght, the Martyrology of Ãengus, the Stowe Missal and possibly a hymn in honour of Saint Michael. Additionally, it is likely the Old Irish Table of Penitential Commutations emerged from Tallaght as well, as a complement to the Penitential. From Terryglass (Co. Tipperry), a community headed by MÃ¡el Ruainâs disciple MÃ¡el DÃ­thruib, is extant the so-called âTallaght Memoirâ (in three recensions: the âMonastery of Tallaght,â the Rule of the CÃ©li DÃ©, and the Teaching of MÃ¡el Ruain). An array of other sources may have been influenced by or relevant to the CÃ©li DÃ© movement (especially, the poems of Blathmac Mac Con Brettan and the Rule of Fothad).   It is unclear whether the different settlements were united in a sort of monastic federation or were independent bodies sharing a common spirituality. The number of the communities is also unclear: the membership of Terryglass is quite certain, as are those of the monastic houses mentioned in the \"Lucht Ãentad MaÃ­le Ruain\" (in Leinster and East Munster). The term CÃ©le DÃ© (while consolidated in academia) is somewhat misleading, as it was employed by religious individuals without MÃ¡el Ruain's tradition too. Apparently, they called themselves \"maic bethad\" (Sons of Life) more often than \"CÃ©li DÃ©\" (Clients or Companions of God). The group was constituted by monks (both ordained and not), nuns, para-monastic married tenants and at least some high-ranking members of the warrior aristocracy (such as Fedelmid mac Crimthainn, who became king of Cashel and over-king of Munster in the ninth century). The CÃ©li DÃ© were characterised by their high regard for the Old Testament, which was expressed in their strict Sabbatarianism and their concern for ritual purity (sexual, alimentary and death-related taboos). They also enforced a complex and all-encompassing system of spiritual surveillance through detailed and frequent confession, called âanmchairdesâ (soul-friendship). The CÃ©le DÃ© have been studied quite deeply in the past centuries (mostly by Reeves, Hughes, OâDwyer and Etchingham in the past). The most recent and throrough monograph is Westley Follettâs âCÃ©li DÃ© in Irelandâ (2007).",

    "description": "Shamanism has co-existed with Buddhism for many centuries in the Mongolian cultural region. Shamanic practices pre-date the arrival of Buddhism in the region which first became a state religion during the reign of Chinggis Khanâs grandson Khubilai Khan (r. 1260â1294). Shamanic practices and shamans have been the subject of religious oppression both by Buddhist institutions and more recently during the socialist period (1921-1990). Since the Democratic Revolution of 1989-1990, shamanism is once again allowed to be practiced in the public sphere. Since 1990 there has been a significant increase in the number of shamans and shamanic ceremonies in Mongolia. Shamanism in Mongolia differs from shamanism further north in Siberia due to the types of spirits that are channelled. Siberian shamans religious practices tend to be more animistic, channelling spirits as anthropologist Morten Pedersen puts it, âhorizontallyâ. Mongolian shamans, on the other hand, channel ancestor spirits âverticallyâ. These are human spirits located within social hierarchies. Mongolian shamans typically communicate with an allied spirit or an âongonâ who are the spirits of deceased human beings, generally within the shamanâs family. These spirits are historically located, reflecting specific genealogies. The presence of other spirits in the landscape is accepted by shamans, however it is not generally the focus of their ritual practice. Novice shamans are often found during shamanic ceremonies. Shamans can be recruited through extensive illnesses for which no cure can be found or other difficulties. Some men can become trapped in a semi-shamanic like state characterised by aggression and alcoholism which is known as âagsanâ. Once a shaman establishes a relationship with an ongon they should carry out regular ceremonies and ritual offerings to maintain the relationship. Shamanic spirits donât tend to provide eschatological or ontological answers, rather they provide advice for success in this life. Mongolian shamans enter a trance state without the use of drugs. They wear heavy clothing and a corded mask. Drumming and dancing is part of the trance state. Some shamans identify as yellow shamans as their practices include Buddhist elements.",

    "description": "Pushtimarg was developed by Vallabhacarya (1479â1531 CE), a Vedic philosopher who emphasised the Bhagavad Purana (a religious text of Hinduism). As a form of North Indian bhakti (devotion), the sampradaya follows Krishna as Shrinathji (as well as his other forms though focus is on his childhood). Vallabhacarya did not preach a life of asceticism or renunciation. His monistic philosophy was called Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism) where the focus is on the Supreme Being as personal, with the potential of developing a relationship. The Pushtimarg is a householder sampradaya (community) and therefore generating wealth and having a family are important parts of Krishna's world that he created for his lila (play). \n\nHistorically, the popularity of the bhakti movement in India was twofold; âOne the one hand, bhakti bypassed the hierarchy and ritualism of the Vedic sacrifices, monopolised by Brahmans and sponsored by their wealthy twice-born patrons, by teaching that salvation was open to all, regardless of caste, wealth, or sex, through the sincere and spontaneous expression of love for the divine. On the other hand, bhakti provided a more practicable alternative to the disciplined path followed by the renouncerâ (Bennett 1993; 2). \n\nThe community is dispersed globally, from Mozambique to Australia. In the 1990s, Pushtimarg gurus (who are called goswamis and are descendants of Vallabhacharya)  began to travel more frequently to the diasporas around the US and Europe though this trend came relatively late compared to other forms of North Indian Krishna worship (e.g. Hare Krishna or ISKCON and the Swaminarayan faith).",

    "description": "The word Vodun means spirit in Fon and Ewe, two languages spoken in coastal Benin, Togo, and South East of Ghana. The Vodun religion is an ancestral religion common to the population living in the west African coastal corridor covering the countries mentioned above. The deities comprise of the supreme god and intermediary gods who cover different domain of life. The supreme god is known as âMawuâ, a benevolent god who has the control of the whole universe. The Vodun religion in its encounter with imported religions was associated to a demonic religion and continues to lose membership due to the westernization of the region. The contemporary Vodun religion evolves in an environment where most members practice syncretism with Islam and Christianism and most members are secretive in their allegiance to the Vodun gods.\nFor contemporary Vodun worshippers, the supreme god Mawu is most of the time assimilated to a monotheist god. Depending on the tribe, Mawu is either a female or a male or both. Mawu plays a moderator role in that all the intermediary godsâ actions are controlled. Below Mawu, there are seven intermediary divinities. These intermediary gods are active in everyday life and play a role in their domain. Sakpata is the god of the Earth. HÃªbioso is the thunder god. Agbe is known as the god of the sea. GÃ» represents the god of war. AgÃª is in the domain of agriculture. Finally, LÃªgba is the unpredictable god and serves as the contact point with the other gods. The ambivalence of modern worshippers is mostly visible in the rituals and sacrifices made to these gods in order to change the course of life in the changed world. Though some of Vodun priests can be found in the inner cities, the majority are located in rural area reinforcing the mystery and secrecy that surround them and their practitioners. Blood sacrifices, incantations, rituals, and the confinement of children and women in Vodun convents are some of the practices of this religion. \nContemporary Vodun practitioners have adapted their religion to their time. With the introduction of monotheist religions, Vodun was predicted to disappear. Instead, Vodun continues to survive and has expanded to the diaspora where the Vodun has become an identity issue for former African slavesâ descendants in the Caribbean islands and the Americas. Even in contemporary West Africa, Vodun is used to affirm the African identity of its members in comparison to African Muslims and Christians.",

    "description": "European missionaries brought Christianity to Sub Saharan Africa with the goal of converting the population of the region. They were indeed successful in that the local population took Christianism and made it their own. Hence was born African Independent Churches in the early twentieth century leading later to the Pentecostal movement. After the wave of independences from colonial rule in the 1960s, the independent churches thrived until the 1970s when the Pentecostal movement which was at that point an underground movement became full blown. It is now becoming the dominant form of Christianity in Africa attracting converts from all religions, tribal and ethnic groups, and all walks of life. \n\nThe movement is defined by the day of Pentecost and refers to the encounter with God in the Bibleâs book of the Acts of the apostles. Pentecostals believe they receive an impartation of Godâs spirit when they confess the name of Jesus. Its main pillars are the concept of being born again, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongue, the divine healing, the eschatological belief of the return of Jesus Christ, and all wrapped in the concept of the full gospel. First, the concept of âborn againâ refers to a spiritual birth of an individual which in the African context connect the person to the invisible world. Second, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a Christian concept of spiritual empowerment which is also found in African spiritual belief which gives the person a spiritual awareness and discernment. Third, the divine healing mimics African belief that a person can be supernaturally healed in opposition to modern medicine. Finally, the return of Jesus Christ is similar to African eschatological belief that there is an invisible world out there which controls the visible world.\n\n In fact, African cosmology assumes two worlds: one which is invisible and populated with spirits and the other which is the visible world. The interaction between the invisible and visible worlds determines humanâs faith. Pentecostals practice exorcisms where evil spirits are cast out followed with weeping, laughing, and screaming. They engage in what is known as spiritual warfare, praying, and fasting. These beliefs are ingrained in Africansâ psyche and were comfortably found in Pentecostal belief generating what is known as African Pentecostalism. It gives people a sense of self, meaning, and reconcile years of exploitation with the newfound identity. It encourages free enterprise, hard work, and self-determination.",

    "description": "This group includes all Catholics in the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) (i.e. mainland China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) from its founding in 1949 to the present. It includes believers who participate in the registered (or \"above ground\") part of the church as well as the unregistered (or \"underground\") part of the church, and those in both urban and rural locations.\nIn 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Chairman Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist Party (KMT), and established the PRC, there were an estimated four million Catholics in China. Whereas the KMT government supported them and had established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, the CCP (even before 1949) had begun to persecute Catholics as agents of foreign imperialism. Broader CCP efforts to eradicate all religion in favor of Marxist atheism began in the 1950s. Fr. Beda Chang (Zhang Boda å¼ ä¼¯è¾¾), the first Catholic martyr under CCP rule, was martyred in 1951. After resisting CCP pressure, a large group of Catholics in Shanghai, including its first Chinese bishop, Ignatius Kung Pin-mei (Gong Pinmei é¾åæ¢), was arrested in 1955. \nIn 1957 the government established the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), a government body responsible for ensuring compliance with the demand that the Church in China must be âindependentâ and self-sustaining, with no official ties to the Vatican or the Pope. A percentage of clergy accepted these demands, and formed the state-approved official, or âabove-groundâ church, while the majority of Catholics, who rejected these demands as incompatible with the Catholic faith, became known as the unofficial, or âundergroundâ Church. The CCPA began orchestrating the appointment of bishops without papal approval, which continued until 2018, when a controversial agreement between the Holy See and the PRC government was signed. Since 2018, the government has continued to pressure underground clergy to agree to a separation, or âindependenceâ from the Holy See.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), all perceived political enemies of Mao were persecuted, and believers of all religions, including official and underground Christians were killed or suffered mental or physical mistreatment. After Maoâs death, official churches reopened, but still under the CCPAâs oversight. To the surprise of many, the number of Christians had grown during these silent years, and continued to expand from the 1980s to the present. Today China has an estimated 10-12 million Catholics, and many more Protestant Christians.",

    "description": "Orphism was a mystery cult of enduring perplexity: it is of obscure origin, vague doctrine, diverse practice, loose membership, and indeterminate extinction.  Its sole fixture is the centrality of a canon of largely eschatological texts attributed by believers to the mythical Orpheus.  The cult is attested textually in the mid 5th c. B.C. and  archaeologically from the 4th c. B.C. to the 3rd A.D.  The most extensive writings about it were by non-practitioners, principally Neoplatonists and Christians, writing centuries after the last archaeological evidence of its being practised.  It may have had scattered adherents into the 4th c. A.D., as evidenced by the composition of the Orphic Argonautica.  It appears not to have survived under the Christianization of the Roman Empire.\n\n|  The very term âOrphismâ appears to be an exonym, but it is accepted as a valid in so far as there were, according to Plato, missionaries called orpheotelestai, whom he portrays as charlatans, and Orphikoi, writers of Orphic texts.  Modern scholarship on Orphism may be divided into minimalist and maximalist schools: the minimalist, predominant until the 1970âs, and represented by Willamowitz, defines Orphism as merely Orphic texts and teachers thereof, with no fixed doctrine; the maximalists, e.g. Graf and Johnston, as a community of eschatological belief coÃ¯nciding indefinitely with the cult of Dionysus, possessed of peculiar texts, rituals, initiators, initiates, and missionaries.  \n\n  |  The core of modern knowledge of Orphism is the Orphica, a body of poems of doubtful authorship, but which believers ascribed to Orpheus (non-believers explicitly doubted the attribution), whose matter treats with a distinct theogony and exchatology.  Besides this are other texts of ritualistic nature, many shared with the Dionysian tradition.  These texts are preserved principally in the Derveni papyrus (the oldest Greek papyrus, and one of the most remarkable ever discovered), and the diverse aureae lamellae (Golden Tablets), eminent among which is the Gold Leaf from Hipponium.  They contain eighty-seven hexametric hymns, along with twenty-four rhapsodies.\n\n|  Much of what is now taken to be Orphic doctrine was  formalized by Neoplatonic philosophers in late antiquity, such as Proclus, Olympiodorus, and Damascius, who were writing long after new Orphica had ceased to be produced.  In fact, it appears that multiple theogonies circulated among the Orphica, in the form of commentaries on the sacred texts.  Their shared features, which are at most a vague approximation of what may inaccurately be termed Orphic doctrine, suggest a belief in manâs dual nature, viz., Titanicâwicked and Olympianâgood; possibly, an original sin; almost certainly, a concern with initiation and ritual purity that would grant some form of afterlife and escape from rebirth and divine punishment.\n\nThe teletai, or rituals of initiation, are unknown.  As in contemporary mystery cults, the rites were probably known only to a specialist class.  While the mysteries revealed at initiation do not appear in ancient sources, some idea of their nature may be formed from the Orphic texts.  To judge from the opening of the Derveni papyrus, it is likely that initiation into the Orphic mysteries entailed learning the distinctive theogony presented in the literature.  Platoâs references, the Orphic Argonautica, and the Lithica (on the magical properties of certain stones) strongly suggest a belief in purificatory magic.\n\n|  In sum, if any essence of Orphism is to be found, it is in adherentsâ belief that certain texts, mainly about theogony and eschatology, were composed by Orpheus and spoke the truth.  The interpretation of these texts, as elsewhere in Greek religion, was not a matter of fixed doctrine.",

    "description": "Salafis' main aim is to practice Islam as the \"pious predecessors\" (al-salaf al-salih) of Prophet Muhammad practiced it. This means overlooking or even shunning any practice or belief that is deemed an accretion to what the earliest Muslims did or believed. Salafi thought is often linked to the Saudi Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, but scholarship suggests that the movement has roots in 19th century Islamic Egyptian thought. Traces of Salafi practice and belief can be found worldwide.\nThe main sources of Sunni practice and beliefs are the Qur'an, the normative example of the Prophet Muhammad (sunna) and the lifestyle of the early generation of Muslims. \nThe intellectual roots of the movement lie in the thought of the eighteenth-century Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn âAbd al-Wahhab (d.1791). A man of little traditional religious training, Ibn âAbd al-Wahhab nonetheless sought to rectify what he perceived to be the unlawful accretions to Islam and Islamic practice that he observed in his people in what is today Saudi Arabia. He wanted to eliminate the practice of venerating saints and sought to place tawhid (the belief in Allahâs oneness) at the center of Islamic belief. Any actions that were deemed antithetical to this or were seen as an innovation (bidâa) were to be condemned and eliminated.  \nBut the term Salafism is a tricky one. Scholars like Henri LauziÃ¨re explain that there are two usages for the term. Although modernists religious scholars like Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (d. 1897) and Muhammad âAbduh (d. 1905) did not actually call themselves Salafi, they are often credited with having spearheaded the movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These âModernist Salafis,â as LauziÃ¨re calls them, strove to ârearticulate their religion in terms that were more relevant to contemporary realities and more intelligible and appealing to the rational minds of the educated elite.â  Like Ibn âAbd al-Wahhab, they viewed the immediate followers of Prophet Muhammad (al-salaf al-salih) as the exemplars of pious Islam. They were thus committed to the example of the salaf and to the text but did not believe that this should be a hindrance on their ability to adapt aspects of the law to help the Muslim world (umma) move forward in the ever-changing, modernizing world.  \nâPurist Salafis,â on the other hand, are exclusionary in that they view that theirs is the only form of Islam that could lead to salvation. It is the pure Islam of the salaf, âunsullied by any innovation, deviation or accretion and uncontaminated by exogenous influencesâ that should be followed by all.  LauziÃ¨re argues, however, that, in the beginning, Purist Salafism did not completely reject religious compromise. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, leading Salafi activists âmodified their understanding of Islamic reformâ¦mainly to accommodate political considerations and to increase the likelihood of achieving political independence from colonial powers.â  They thus constructed a rigorist form of Salafism that emphasized purity but sought to unite and gain a following throughout the Muslim world.  Post-independence, however, Purist Salafis no longer had to downplay their exclusionary vision of Islam. This form of Salafism âresponded to the challenge of modernity by escaping to the secure haven of the text, but it treated rational moral insight as fundamentally corrupting of the purity of the Islamic message,â stunting its growth and ability to respond to modern needs and inquiries.  Despite this, it was the purists who continued to thrive, while modernists, having played their part during the colonial period, fell by the wayside.\nStates like Saudi Arabia sought to spread this brand of Salafism globally since the 1970s through preachers, funding Salafi mosques and promoting and distributing Salafi texts worldwide.",

    "description": "A Christian denomination in the Wesleyan/Holiness tradition which broke away from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1860. The major issue leading to the split concerned disagreements over slavery. The Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) still had many slaveholders after the schism in 1844 saw the creation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MEC, S). Official church policy recognized slaveholding as sin, but in practice had accepted the reality of the practice and attempted to justify it under several theories (e.g., paternalism toward slaves, keeping slaveholders in the church). Roberts and other abolitionists saw this compromise as a violation of the ethical precepts of Christianity and their Wesleyan heritage (John Wesley had was an abolitionist in Britain). However, the direct cause of the formation of the Free Methodist Church was a series of political maneuvers in Robertsâ home conference which saw Roberts and several other pastors expelled from the MEC. There is a split in the scholarship as to whether Robertâs abolitionist views lead to the political maneuvers or was merely one view amongst many that angered important parts of the churchâs hierarchy (see Snyder, 406-7).\n\tUpon establishing the new denomination, Roberts ended the practice of âpew rentingâ by which wealthy individuals could ârentâ a pew in church with better visibility, both for and of themselves. He also ended instrumental music in churches, not on grounds against such music, but against the practice of paying trained musicians out of the churchâs funds which could have gone to other needs. Like much of the holiness tradition of the nineteenth century, simplicity was a virtue.\nCurrently, the church has less than 100,000 members in the United States but totals more the one million total members worldwide. It is episcopal in organization with three bishops, each based in the USA. The church is connected to five universities in the United States: Roberts Wesleyan in New York, Spring Arbor in Michigan, Greenville University in Illinois, Central Christian University in Kansas, and Seattle Pacific in Washington; and another four internationally. The church is also affiliated with several non-denominational schools, including Azusa Pacific in California, and Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky.\nThe Free Methodist Church fits nearly all definitions of âevangelicalâ and members are generally theologically and politically conservative (in the USA) though the latter has more diversity among congregants. Among the other Wesleyan related churches, Free Methodists are most similar in theology to the Church of the Nazarene and the conservative (sometimes called âtraditionalâ) wing of the United Methodist Church due to their teachings of both progressive and instantaneous sanctification at some point after justification. This experience has many names from different theologians but most use the terms âEntire Sanctificationâ or âSecond work of graceâ to describe it.",

    "description": "The Branch Davidians were a millenarian sect active in the United States from 1960âs through 1993. The group developed out of a Seventh-Day Adventist offshoot called the Davidian Adventists, which believed itself to be the pure remnant of a now-global Adventist church that had grown lax and sinful. In contrast to Adventist understandings that the Kingdom of God would come about through a spiritual transformation of the world, the Davidians taught that the Kingdom of God would be physically established by a second Christ in the modern-day land of Palestine. In 1935, the Davidians moved to a large farm in Waco, TX, from which they proselytized (mainly by mail) about the imminent return of Christ.\n\nAfter the death of Davidian founder Victor Houteff in 1955 (and after Christ failed to materialize on the day that Houteffâs widow predicted in 1959) the group began to splinter, and by the early 1960âs it re-coalesced around members Ben and Lois Roden, who both eventually assumed the mantle as prophets and renamed the group the âBranch Davidians.â In 1981, a recent convert named Vernon Howell began to stake claims to the prophetic role that Lois Roden still held. Out of the power struggles that followed Rodenâs death in the mid-1980s, Howell emerged the clear leader of the Branch Davidians. After a trip to Israel where he claimed to have had a vision of angelic forces, in 1990 he legally changed his name to David Koresh and began to teach that he was a second Christ sent to complete the mission that Jesus had started by ushering in the end of days. \n\nKoresh and a group of over 100 followers lived communally at Mount Carmel, their compound in Waco, Texas. There, members participated in lengthy daily Bible studies led by Koresh. They believed that he had been sent by God to reveal the full meaning of the Christian Bible, and in particular, to unfold the narrative of the imminent apocalypse. They believed the apocalypse would be triggered by a conflict between the Branch Davidians and the forces of âBabylonâ that would take place in the land of Palestine at some point in the near future. Aiming to purify themselves in preparation for the end of days, they sought to live as a perfect community; they came to see themselves as a divine family, with adults spiritually married to Koresh and all of the children spiritually his â and many of them biologically his own, as well. \n\nIn the spring of 1993, when federal agents â legally spurred by an arrest warrant for Koresh on weapons charges, but also deeply motivated by fears driven by the anti-cult movement â began a violent siege on the groupâs compound. After 51 days, the compound went up in flames, killing 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh. The movement was effectively ended, though some believers survived, and though some other groups have risen up to claim the name of Branch Davidian. Some elements of life at Mount Carmel remain contested to this day, with conflicting reports from members and disaffected ex-members emerging during and after the siege.",

    "description": "In 1948, young sisters Maggie and Katy Fox reported to their family that not only was there a spirit living in their house, but theyâd learned how to communicate with it. Friends and neighbors around their house in upstate New York came to bear witness to the spiritâs ârappings,â the girls quickly became celebrity mediums, and the Spiritualist movement took off. \n\nSpiritualism coalesced around a belief that the dead live on in a âspirit worldâ separated from the world of the living by a thin veil. In this spirit world, individual identities and personal connections persist, and the dead can continue to grow and to spiritually mature. The movementâs central practices include seances, trance lectures, mediumship, healings, and other modes of communication with the spirit world. The commercial success of events like public seances and products like Ouija boards have blurred the line between Spiritualism-as-entertainment and Spiritualism-as-religion from the traditionâs earliest days. Spiritualists also eschew central organization and have no formal markers of religious affiliation, so no precise figures exist for affiliation. However, scholars estimate that anywhere from 3 to 11 million Americans were participating in Spiritualism at the movementâs peak in the late 19th century.\n\nDrawing on previous religious traditions like Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, and New Thought, Spiritualism followed in the iconoclastic footprints of other new religious movements that came out of the Burned-over District in the 19th century. Early Spiritualists denounced dogmatism and sectarianism of organized religion, and spoke out against the Calvinist notion that humankind is innately sinful. In turn, most Christian churches explicitly disavowed Spiritualism, warning congregants that it was a fraud â or worse, that it was witchcraft. Still, many Spiritualists have historically been practicing Christians, and some churches (especially Quaker, Universalist, and Unitarian churches) have either tacitly or even explicitly welcomed Spiritualism as an outgrowth of Christian practice. Some Spiritualists founded churches of their own, and several associations of Spiritualist Churches exist to this day. The movement also had strong ties to social reform movements, including abolition and womenâs suffrage.\n\nSpiritualist practice was originally centered in the northern U.S., with another notable pocket of popularity around New Orleans. English-language periodicals, Spiritualist camps, and travelling mediums also connected American practitioners to a transnational network that grew to extend through Great Britain, parts of Canada. The movement was also briefly in vogue throughout continental Europe. Although Spiritualism experienced another surge of popularity in the wake of WWI, it has never regained its 19th century status in the religious and cultural mainstream.",

    "description": "Before the socialist period (1921-1990), Buddhism was the main religion in Mongolia. In 1936, before the violent religious purges of the late 1930s there were around 767 monasteries in Mongolia and somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 lamas (robed monastics) in the country. By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country, an estimated 14,000 having been killed during the period. Following these purges of the late 1930s, religious activities of all kinds were severely restricted during the socialist period. Only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid was allowed to operate in Mongoliaâs capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Due to active repression during the socialist period, most of the attendees of this temple were the elderly, particularly older women. In the winter of 1989-1990, Mongolia, dialoguing with broader democratic movements in the socialist world, had a Democratic Revolution. Following the revolution, religious freedoms were ensured and people once again began to practice religion in public. Since 1990, Buddhism has become one of the main religions in Mongolia, mostly following the VajrayÄna tradition. Although it shares many similarities with other VajrayÄna schools, in particular the Gelug and Nyingma lineages, Buddhism in Mongolia has unique characteristics that come from its local religious heritage, Mongolian beliefs systems and translocal organised religious groups, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. Following the lifting of religious restrictions at the start of the democratic period, Mongolian lamas who had been lamas before the socialist purges once again donned robes and began to practice in public. These lamas reinhabited old temples and built new ones and began to take on new students. These lamas set about reinvigorating old traditions that had been kept alive in secret during the socialist period or remembered from their youth. At the same time as local practices were re-emerging, transnational Buddhist organisations (mostly from the VajrayÄna lineages) came to Mongolia to assist local efforts to re-establish Buddhism in the country. Many young novices were encouraged to go to India to study at monasteries connected to Tibetans in diaspora. Postsocialist Buddhist practice in Mongolia has also been characterized by the growth of other ritual practices and translocal religious traditions. These include local ritual practices, such as Mongolian shamanism, that have been gaining in popularity during the democratic period, and translocal religious traditions, such as Christianity and new religious movements. Buddhism in the contemporary period, as was the case in the presocialist period, has geopolitical significance. Its historical ties to Tibet and the Dalai Lama have been the source of geopolitical tensions with China. The relationships between Tibetans in diaspora and international organizations have internally affected Mongolian Buddhist hierarchies as well as lay Buddhist beliefs.",

While esoteric Buddhist activities suffered severely in the capital Changan, it was believed that a lay Buddhist named Liu Juzhi æ³å±ç´ (855-907, also known as Liu Benzun æ³æ¬å°, âthe principle master Liuâ) received the transmission of esoteric Buddhist teachings, especially the incantations efficacious in curing diseases and eliminating evil spirits, and devoted himself to spreading his teachings in Yizhou çå· (nowadays Chengdu æé½) and surrounding areas. \n\nGrottoes related to Liu Benzunâs esoteric Buddhist cult were built in Anyue å®å²³ and Dazu å¤§è¶³ county in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

Baoding, these grottoes belonged to Buddhist practitioner Zhao Zhifeng's è¶æºé³³ (1159-1249) carving project, which aimed at propagating esoteric Buddhist teachings inherited from his patriarch Liu Benzun as well as the secular value of filial piety. Evidence of this carving projectâs emphasis on the esoteric tradition can be found as the inscription in niche 21, which writes Liu Benzunâs honorific title as âthe supreme master of Tang Esoteric Buddhism.â \n\nDue to the lack of extant historical texts, the study of Liu Benzunâs esoteric Buddhist cult was limited to the analyses of stele inscriptions, sculptures, and stone relief carvings. Most scholars hold the opinion that, contrary to the statement claimed in his biographical inscriptions, Liu Benzun did not obtain an orthodox transmission from Tang esoteric Buddhist patriachs. Moreover, scholars remain skeptical about the account of Zhao Zhifengâs studying at the major practice hall of Liuâs teachings. Based on interpretations of the carvings at Mt. Baoding, scholars suggest that Zhao established this site as a cultic center where the cult of the deified lay Buddhist Liu Benzun was integrated with Mahayana Buddhist traditions, Confucianism, and Daoism. \n\nThe stone inscription and tableaux preserved in Anyue and Dazu areas illustrated that the esoteric Buddhist cult prevalent in the Sichuan area from Late Tang to Southern Song was a regional Buddhist cult with distinctive doctrines and practices which embodied an amalgamation of Tang esoteric tradition, exoteric Buddhist traditions, and local beliefs.",

    "description": "The Nyingma Treasure tradition is a subgroup of practitioners within the Nyingma (Rnying ma) School of Tibetan Buddhism. Its scripture authority comes from revealed texts (with varying methods for revelation), rather than translated or transmitted texts from India.\n\n\nIn contrast to the Sarma (Gsar ma, literally the âNew Schoolâ) traditions, who draw their scriptural authority from newly transmitted and translated scriptures from India, the Nyingma School (literally the âOld Schoolâ) traces its religious pedigree back to the time of the Tibetan Empire. There are two modes of scriptural transmissions for the Nyingma School: (1) the distant lineage of transmitted precepts (bkaâ ma); and (2) the close lineages of Treasures (gter ma). The distant lineage of transmitted precepts refers to (oral) teachings that can be traced back to the Buddhaâs time through an unbroken lineage; while the close lineages of Treasures refer to revealed teachings that are said to be concealed by enlightened masters of the past and assigned to be rediscovered by predestined Treasure revealers (gter ston) in the future.\n\n\nThe Treasures come in two forms, materials objects and sacred texts. The origins of these Treasures are usually associated with Buddhist masters from India who visited Tibet in the past. The most important teacher associated with the Treasure tradition is the Indian tantric master Padmasambhava (Vimalamitra is also a popular choice at this time, although his important diminished compared to Padmasambhava in later times). He is said to have visited Tibet at the request of the Buddhist king Tri Songdetsen (Khri srong lde btsan), where he subjugated many local deities and spirits, converted them to protectors of Buddhism, defeated the opposing Bon masters, commissioned many translations of Buddhist texts, and left behind Treasure teachings all over Tibet. Yeshe Tsogyel, his main consort and disciple, is said to be responsible for the concealment of these teachings, entrusting them to local guardian deities, and ensuring their successful delivery to future Treasure revealers.\n\n\nThe process of Treasure discovery usually begins with a vision or a dream of prophecy. The Treasure revealer will be told in the vision or dream about the place, time, and method for extracting the Treasure. After a successful retrieval, s/he will usually receive a Treasure casket and/or a yellow scroll with encoded letters or khandroma scripts (mkhaâ âgro ma, or á¸ÄkinÄ«). Because of this association, as well as her special talent with language and words, the goddess khandroma, in her divine or human form, is commonly summoned in the process of decoding the Treasure scroll. After decoding, the Treasure revealer then records the teaching in writing and form a Treasure cycle. A standard cycle of Treasure teaching usually includes multiple genres, starting with a certificate authenticating the teaching, and ranging from ritual manuals, oral instructions, life stories, religious histories, prophecies, and doctrinal exegeses.",

    "description": "The âTaigu Schoolâ å¤ªè°·å­¸æ´¾ (and its various alternative names, such as âTaigu Teachingâ å¤ªè°·æ, âYellow Cliff Teachingâ é»å´æ, âKongtong Teachingâ å´å³æ, âGreat Learning Teachingâ å¤§å­¸æ, âGreat Achievement Teachingâ å¤§ææ, etc.) refers to an esoteric genealogy of teaching in China spanning from the eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. The founding patriarch, Zhou Taigu å¨å¤ªè°· (c. 1762âc. 1832, aka Zhou Gu å¨ç©, Zhou Xingyuan å¨æå£, Kongtongzi ç©ºåå­/å´å³å­, etc.), was from the Anhui province but mainly preached in Yangzhou of the Jiangnan region. The documentation of him is rare and often vague, but his\nfollowers believed he was the fifth âSageâ (following the several ancient âSage-Kingsâ and Confucius) who had inherited the true \"Way,\" and it was reported (probably distortedly) that he had mastered various forms of occult arts, including divination, cure, talismans, incantations, exorcism, invisibility, and the sexual cultivation. Among his many followers, Zhang Jizhong å¼µç©ä¸­ (c. 1805â1866, aka Zhang Shiqin å¼µç³ç´, Qi xiansheng ä¸åç, among many other aliases) brought his teaching to the north. In 1856, Zhang settled his family at Yellow Cliff é»å´å±±, a remote mountain in Shandong province. More and more people and households joined him, and gradually a semi-independent community took shape. The community did have religious features, but it was by and large based on mutual aid and self-defense in order to keep safely away from the various rebel militia in that time. Nonetheless, it was accused as an âevil cultâ and sanguinary oppressed by the local government in 1866, an incident that is usually known as the âYellow Cliff Massacre.â Zhangâs cousin and fellow disciple, Li Guangxin æåç (1808â1885, aka Li Qingfeng ææ´å³°, Li Pingshan æå¹³å±± and Longchuan xiansheng é¾å·åç, among many other aliases), preached in the Jiangnan region and accumulated numerous followers, mostly men of letters, including many contemporary celebrities, such as the politician Mao Qingfan æ¯æ¶è© (1849â1927) and the novelist Liu E åé¶ (1857â1909). Starting from 1902, the teaching was based in the Guiqun Academy æ­¸ç¾¤èå  in Suzhou and was led by Liâs disciple Huang Baonian é»èå¹´ (1845â1924, aka Huang Xipeng é»é°æ and Huang Guiqun é»æ­¸ç¾¤), which was commonly known as the âHuang School é»éâ until it gradually declined and finally dissolved in the mid-twentieth century. The teaching defies a rash generalization. Extant analects of Zhou Taigu are mostly his idiosyncratic exegesis on the Confucian classic The Book of Change æç¶, which has a syncretic inclination, integrating the Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist thoughts and even Millennialism beliefs. Biographical accounts of Zhou Taigu are also full of miracles, which resemble what are often seen in what we now call âpopular religionsâ or âfolk religions.â This tendency toward mysticism is observable in both Zhang Jizhongâs Yellow Cliff community and Li Guangxinâs master-disciple lineage. However, Huang Baonian, who was already a prominent Confucian scholar before leading the Guiqun Academy, made clear efforts of eliminating the occult elements from the teaching and establishing its Confucian legitimism.",

    "description": "Introduction:\nTill this day, there is an aura of mystery surrounding the Orphic cult, or what some call Orphism. Based on the mythological figure Orpheus, who descends into the Underworld in order to save his wife Eurydice only to fail. Orpheus is touted for his musical abilities that charms both goddesses, such as Persephone and animals. His musical prowess becomes divine and in the Classical period of the 5th century BC begins to acquire the reputation of establishing a cult according to Plato, Euripides, and, perhaps, Pindar.\n\nNot much is known about the Orphic Cult itself save the textual evidence from the Deverni Papyrus, the golden lamellae, and the so-called âOrphic hymnsâ. Because of its mysterious nature, scholars come into passionate disagreement over the years: 1) some, such as Edmonds, deny the existence of an Orphic cult, 2) others, like Graf and Johnston, claim that âOrphic/Orphismâ was used anytime the ancients wanted to demarcate as something strange, and non-tradition, 3) those who argue on behalf of an Orphic Cult. In recent years, however, it seems that 4) must scholars support the idea of an Orphic movement that spread throughout the Mediterranean in the peripheries of the Greek world, especially in Magna Graecia: the Greek colonies in Italy.\n\nThe flourishing of Orphism in Magna Graecia coincides with the advent and proliferation of Pythagoreanism during the same period of the 6th and 5th centuries BC. This has led scholars to notice similarities in the two movements, such as vegetarianism, because both sects believed that the soul could reincarnate into animals, a focus on purity especially in the material world, and a conception of a happy afterlife if the soul remains pure. One wonders whether Magna Graecia and the Italic-Greeks had a knack for eschatological ideas during the 6th and 5th centuries BC, whereas their mainland counterparts would have to wait until the Classical period 5th and 4th for these ideas to travel eastward. If this is right, one can begin to see cracks on old standing narratives: 1) a monolithic idea of Greekness and 2) the perpetual misunderstanding that Greek influence is a one way street where Hellenism is always the influencer and never the influenced. \n\nOrphic Movement\nReturning to the Orphic cult, the little evidence that we possess seems to indicate a scattered cult with shared ideas in cosmology found in the Derveni Papyrus and some golden lamellae and the instructions for the soul in afterlife, found in the golden lamellae that were buried with the deceased. These primary ancient documents detail strange myths and an Underworld that is unfamiliar to anyone who has read the traditional tales of Hesiod and Homer, especially the centerfold position that Dionysius holds in the âTheogony of Orpheusâ and the Zagreus myth scattered in the Derveni Papyrus and later in the âDionysiacaâ of the 5th century AD Neoplatonist Nonnos.\n\nCosmology:\nThe Theogeny of Orpheus gives the reader a sense of departure of the Orphic cosmology from the Hesiodic one. Time produces an egg with a serpent enwrapped around it. From the egg is born Protogonos the first god who begins to fashion the universe in a way similar to that of Hesiodâs gods: sexually.  From there on come the other gods: Night followed by Ouranous who produces the Titans and from them come the Zeus and Olympians. Zeus then swallows Protogonos and keeps him in his belly in order to recreate the universe. It seems in some places that Protogonos and Zeus become linked in one god. The closest resemblance here is the birth of Athena after Zeus swallowed her mother Metis. The elision of Zeus and Protogonos can be most easily explained by the need to square competing supreme gods by the Orphic cult. Other scholars also posit that the movement had two supreme deities, but it is not quite clear what is the relationship between the two. Nevertheless, by the early Christian era and Late Antiquity, it is Zeus who claims the titles of âfirstâ, âlastâ, âkingâ, âfateâ, âmiddleâ, and âheadâ. Whatever the case may be, Orphic cosmology, like its traditional Greek counterpart, contains an ordered universe with Zeus in charge whose intervention in the affairs of the world are not quite clear. Yet, one should never consider Orphic cosmology as exclusive and there is the possibility that the myths of the Odyssey and Iliad were integrated somehow in Orphic cosmology.\n\nOne last important medication to the mythic cosmology commonly found in Hesiod is the emphasis of Dionysius role in the myth of Zagreus (Dionysius). According to the Derveni Papyrus commentator and Nonnos, Zeus impregnates Persephone (not Semele), and the latter gives birth to Dionysius. Then, because Zeus marks Dionysius as his successor, the Titans now jealous lure the child Dionysius away with toys, kill Dionysius, and then eat him. In vengeance, and with his furious lightning bolt, Zeus smolders the Titans into black ash whence mankind arises. Then, Zeus and Athena resurrect Dionysius, who either succeeds him in some versions or co-rules with Zeus. As with Protogonos, one can see either a merging of Zeus and Dionysius in the Orphic tradition that represents the unification of Bacchic ritual with more common elements of Greek religion. \n\nFinally, the most striking departure from the Hesiodic and Homeric traditions is the origin of man from the ashes of the Titans. Some lamellae and a fragment of Pindar seem to allude to this myth. Pindar states, as Rose argues, that man has an ancient grief of the blood guilt in the murder of Persephoneâs son. This has led many to believe that the Orphic cult had an idea of soteriology where mankind needs to live a pure life in order to redeem himself so that he may dwell among the heroes as some lamellae state. Pace Rose et alia, Edmonds points to the fact that the only complete version of the Zagreus myth occurs in Nonnos, almost a full millennia after the Derveni Papyrus and that it cannot represent what occurred in the 6th-4th centuries BC. The idea of a fallen man, as Edmonds argue, comes from Christianity in two ways: 1) Nonnos is alive in a period when Christianity is now the official religion of the Roman Empire and many Neoplatonists, like Nonnos and Porphyry, are engage in polemics against Christian intellectuals, and 2) the over-emphasis of the use of texts such as the Derveni Papyrus and the golden lamellae in the 19th-20th century comes from the Protestant-Catholic debate on early Christianity, where Protestants focused on the importance of texts as a concept in order to defend Sola Scriptura. \n\nWhatever happened on the ground in the ancient period, the little evidence shows that there was a Zagreus myth in the air and that the Orphic cult, as expressed in the Lamellae, focus on bodily purification in order to live among mythological heroes. Whether this purification depends upon the Zagreus myth, I shall leave in mystery and allow the reader to riddle out the hidden secrets of the Orphic as we now turn to the Orphic ritual. \n\nRitual:\nApart from what is said in Plato and Euripidesâ âHippolytusâ, Orphic ritual at least had an initiation process that included hymns (whether or not the published âOrphic Hymnsâ were the ones used in the ritual itself). Once the ritual was concluded, the initiate was expected to live a pure life. They could not eat animals since that would require ingesting the soul of a tentative human who reincarnated in the animal. This purity also required the initiate to abstain from murder, since blood in the ancient Greek religion was a source of bodily pollution. Apart from these details, we remain in the dark as to the common ethical behavior of the initiated. Perhaps, Pythagoreanism could serve as a point of comparison, but to generalize too much from one obscure movement Pythagoreanism to another is not conducive. \n\nAt the initiatedâs death, a golden âleafâ was placed with the deceased. On this plaque, there are instructions for the soul of the deceased on what he or she do when she is in the Underworld. One group of texts states that the deceased should supplicate the divinities of the Underworld, especially Persephone, in order to pass into the abode of the pure. Another group gives fuller and rather strange instructions. The soul of the initiated must avoid the spring near the white cypress tree and venture to another cold spring that contains the waters of memory. These waters, however, are guarded and the deceased must state that, though he is a child of Earth and Heaven, he is one of heavenly stalk. Once the guards allow him or her, the deceased drinks from the waters and then passes to dwell among the heroes. Some other lamellae add other details. For example, the lamella from Hipponium adds a verb that suggests Bacchic ritual of revelry and madness. Another tablet adds the line âa kid I have fallen in milkâ. Torjussen has argued that milk represents the initiation ritual since milk represents the Mily Way as early as the 7th century BC and also represents the purity of the soul. Thus, the righteous souls would live in the Milky Way whereas the unrighteous in the lands of Hades. Pace Torjusses, this last idea is also common to the Neoplatonists starting with Numenius and a degree of skepticism as to what the milk represents is warranted. \n\nTo conclude some final remarks on Orphism, the mystery cult and its adherents tended to display an asceticism that might have depended on their cosmological and eschatological views: perhaps, a corrupt mankind born from the ashes of the Titans can be redeemed through purification. If this is right, the Orphic cult has a remarkable tenure of a millennia that survives into the early Christian period and Late Antiquity. In fact, Lactantius, one of the earliest Church fathers, mentions that Orpheus was close to the eternal truth when he posited a god creator (Protogonos). Many Neoplatonists of the 4th-5th centuries, beginning with Numenius, co-opted Pythagorean-Orphic ideas into their Platonist thought. Moreover, some scholars have argued that the iconography of the Good Shepherd found in early Christian Roman sarcophagi were coopted from the shepherd motif found in Orphic and Bacchic ritual. In time, however, as the historical record shows, both Christianity and Neoplatonism endured into the Middle Ages, whereas Orphism did not.",

    "description": "Ilm-e-Khshnoom 'Science of Bliss' refers to the religious group primarily composed by members of the Zoroastrian diaspora currently settled in India (henceforth Parsis). They follow the system of beliefs (also named Ilm-e-Khshnoom) introduced by Behramshah Naoroji Shroff (1858-1927) at the beginning of the 20th century. Shroffâs teachings are based upon an esoteric interpretation of the Avesta, which is the collection of sacred Zoroastrian scriptures. Ilm-e-Khshnoom emerged from colonial India, when the Westernisation process exposed the religious vulnerability of the Parsi community. The teachings of Shroff are based on a set of universal laws of nature that span from the idea of reincarnation to that of the vibrational power dwelling in the practice of Zoroastrian rituals. Shroff, a Parsi himself, claimed to have been initiated to Ilm-e-Khshnoom by the SÄheb DelÄn 'Master-Hearts', a secluded community of Zoroastrian spiritual masters in Mount DamÄvand, Iran. During his stay, he allegedly acquired abilities like telepathy and divination techniques such as astrology. The Parsis who follow Ilm-e-Khshnoom nowadays are a small minority of the approximatively 50,000 Zoroastrians who live in India, mainly in Mumbai and in some cities of the state of Gujarat. There are not exclusion or inclusion criteria for the membership of this religious group other than being born from a Zoroastrian family. Nevertheless, ethnocentrism characterises not only the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom but a large part of the Parsi community, in contrast to another part of the community which promote religious reformism and conversions. Furthermore, the transmission of Ilm-e-Khshnoom across generations has occurred through the familiar nucleus. In effect, families continue to exert a durable impact on the religious canons as well as on the communal ideology and responsibility of Parsis. The followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom emphasise a strict observance of the Zoroastrian rituals and adopt particular principles in the ritual practice. These principles remark the importance of addressing precise thoughts while reciting a given portion of the Avesta correctly accompanied by a specific kinetic motion. They also represent distinctive elements of contradistinction of the followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom against the wider Parsi community. Another distinctive element is the adoption of the liturgical calendar. While the Shenshai is the most widespread calendar among the Zoroastrians of India, the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom advocate the adoption of the Fasli calendar. From the 1980âs, Parsis who follow the teachings of Shroff can be found in US and Canada as well as in Australia.",

    "description": "The Antonian Sect (Antonianism) is a religious movement initiated by Dona BÃ©atrice Kimpa Vita, a young enlightened Kongolese leader, from the eighteen century. This religious  movement advocated for the restoration of the kingdom of Kongo through a spiritual approach grounded on local beliefs and practices, and the rejection of western (missionary) beliefs system perceived as ideological and deleterious to the unity and greatness of the kingdom of Kongo. Kimpa Vita believed that God was not white. She also believed that she was the reincarnation of saint Anthony and used these claims to promote the restoration of a unified and powerful Kingdom of Kongo. The deeper issue behind Kimpa Vita's claims was the idea of \"inculturation\" i.e. christian ideals and values must be understood and interpreted through Kongolese cultural paradigms in order to restore and strengthen the unity of the Kongolese kingdom. Her teaching attracted many followers and ultimately became a threat to the missionaries. She was burnt alive by missionaries in 1706. Despite her death and the collapse of the kingdom of Kongo, Kimpa Vita's spiritual and political intuitions (ideas) are embraced by many African and Congolese people who still perceive her as a prefigure to inculturation and Afrocentrist movements. Nowadays, Kimpa Vita's movement continues in a different way through the \"Ngunza religion\" from Congo-Brazzaville. The Ngunzas venerate and practice a ritual dedicated to Kimpa Vita. Thus, Antonianism and Ngunzanism are two sides of the same coin.",

    "description": "Valentinians are an early branch of Christian practitioners that have often been labeled as \"gnostic.\" They are generally understood to be Christians who were influenced by the teachings of Valentinus, a second-century teacher and preacher in Rome. Valentinian Christians are best-known for their treatment of God as totally unknowable before Jesus's appearance, their conception of God as a collective entity of Aeons or emanations of the divine, and their belief in a heavenly counterpart that one needed to reunite with.\n\nOur sources for Valentinian thought are split between their own writings and those of their opponents. Until the 20th century, most of our knowledge of the Valentinians came from heresiologists like Irenaeus of Lyons and Tertullian of Carthage, who wrote tractates that stereotyped and condemned their theologies and practices. We also had a few fragments of Valentinusâs own writings and a letter from the Valentinian Ptolemy to Flora embedded in other patristic texts. With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices in the 1940s, we gained access to a broad array of Valentinian texts. These texts gave us a better understanding of Valentinian liturgical practices, exegetical concerns, and cosmological narratives. \n\nValentinians have been condemned as heretics since the late second century. However, Valentinus himself was never formally condemned during his lifetime, nor was there any mechanism by which to expel him from the Roman churches in the second century. Valentinians often accused of looking âtoo muchâ like other types of Christians and attending the same services, which made them a threat to some Christians who feared that they were duplicitous.\n\nValentinians writings and theological explorations have often been depicted as having two substantial trajectories, known as the Eastern and Western schools. However, recent scholarship has questioned a clear divide between the two schools. Likewise, scholars have recently questioned how âValentinianâ Valentinus himself was, since the cosmological and theological concerns of second- and third-century Valentinian writers often turn in very different directions than the fragments of Valentinus that have been preserved. \n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Valentinian thought if their conception of God as androgynous, and that the various emanations of God exist in male-female dyads. This conception of Godâs completeness as based on twoness is also expressed in Valentinian descriptions of union with the divine, in which one joins with their accompanying angel in the ritual of the âbridal chamberâ in order to achieve redemption.",

    "description": "The New Prophecy refers to the Christian prophetic movement led by the prophets Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla. Later known as \"Montanism,\" the movement began in the second half of the second century CE in Roman Phrygia, which is in the west-central part of Anatolia, present-day Turkey. It quickly spread beyond Phrygia and, by the mid-third century, had reached Rome, Carthage, Thrace, and Gaul. By the early fifth century, no adherents of the New Prophecy movement remained in North Africa (Optatus of Milevis, Against the Donatists 1.9; Augustine Letter 118.12) or Rome (Praedestinatus, 1.86). In the mid-sixth century, Emperor Justinian I's forces, led by John of Ephesus, attacked Pepouza and burned the group's literature, bringing a decisive end to the already dwindling New Prophecy in Asia Minor. \n\n\tThe New Prophecy was controversial. Critics took issue with the movement's ascetic rigor, eschatological beliefs, and the prominent role women played in leading it. However, the most significant source of controversy was the ecstatic prophecies the group's adherents claimed to receive from the Holy Spirit. The movement proclaimed their prophecies constituted supplementary divine revelations with equal or greater authority than those of the previous apostolic traditions. Like the apostle Paul, the New Prophecy, thus, appealed to divine visions as the source of their familiarity with and authorization from Christ. As such, the prophetic movement posed an aggravating challenge to contemporaneous Christian groups whose authority rested entirely upon apostolic succession. \n\n\tIn the late third century, the movement was condemned as a heresy. The term \"Montanism\" was bestowed by fourth-century heresiologists.  Later commentators also called adherents of the New Prophecy Cataphrygians, Pepouzians, Quintillianists, and Priscillianists. Scholars have traditionally referred to the New Prophecy movement of the second and third centuries as \"Montanism,\" despite the fact that it is a fourth-century neologism and imbues connotations of heresy not associated with the movement until the late third century. \n\n\tThe New Prophecy is known almost exclusively through the third- and fourth-century heresiological accounts of the movement's opponents. These sources also provide fourteen oracles, which scholars believe are genuine expressions of the New Prophecy. A few inscriptions and Tertullian's early third-century writings constitute the only evidence for New Prophecy that survives independently of heresiological texts. Identifying specific texts from Tertullian's corpus as \"Montanist\" has prompted scholars to take Tertullian's views as representative of the broader New Prophecy movement. However, scholars have debated the extent to which Tertullian's early third-century writings represent the New Prophecy movement and its teachings. Several of Tertullian's so-called \"Montanist\" works convey idiosyncratic thoughts that are not consistent with the other evidence for the movement. As such, Tertullian must be treated exclusively as a witness to the New Prophecy's Carthaginian reception in the first decades of the third century and not representative of Montanism elsewhere or at other times.",

    "description": "The Methodist/Wesleyan denomination can be said to have commenced in 1738 When John Wesley, an Anglican pastor,  had an experience of the Holy Spirit on the road to Aldersgate in the outskirts of London. He wrote in his Journal, following the teachings of Martin Luther on righteousness that, âI felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.â  One of the distinctive features of Methodism/Wesleyanism is what has become referred to as its âquadrilateral;,â the four sources of ecclesiastical authority. These consist of scripture, tradition, experience, and reason. This supplements the Anglican threefold sources, which consist of scripture, tradition, and reason.\nTo the traditional Reformation doctrines of salvation by faith alone (sola fide) and justification by faith, and antinomianism, John Wesley added certain maxims that distinguished his movement from the larger Reformation tradition. Acutely among them was his notion of perfection in love in the earthly life. This notion is rooted in 1 John:1 12, 17, Hebrews 12:1f., and Matthew 5:48. Christians are to be perfect as their heavenly father is, especially in love. Additionally, Wesley emphasized a doctrine known as âArminianismâ (named for the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius), a rebuke to the Calvinist notion of predestination. Additionally, he stressed the âmeans of graceâ that include of piety, mercy, as well as social and communal practices. With Calvin, Wesley emphasized the âreal presenceâ of Christ in the Eucharistic elements; against Calvin he prescribed an open Communionâeven the unbaptized are welcome at the Table of the Lord (he referred to Communion as a potential âconverting ordinance.â Another chief ordinance is Holy Baptism, performed either in childhood or in adulthood. The United Methodist Book of Worship contends, âThe Baptismal Covenant is God's word to us, proclaiming our adoption by grace, and our word to God, promising our response of faith and love.â Wesley also borrowed the concepts of prevenient grace, original righteousness, and sanctification from other Christian traditions.\nWesleyâs closest associates were his brother Charles (primarily known for his proficient hymnody) and George Whitefield (himself a Calvinist who believed in predestination), as well as his mother, Susannah who was his foremost spiritual consort. Methodism/Wesleyanism gave birth to the Holiness Movement, which in turn gave birth to Pentecostalism. The Church of Jesus Christ, Latter Day Saints, was formed by a former Methodist. Methodist/Wesleyan denominations today include the United Methodist Church (primarily in the United States but with a large following in sub-Saharan Africa), the Church of the Nazarene, the British Methodists, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Zion, and merged, united denominations in Canada, Zambia, and Australia. Most denominations have an episcopal, connexional polity â a bishop presides over larger collections of congregations, a superintendent over more local collections, and an ordained elder over individual (or multiple) local churches.

    "description": "The UAE is home to millions of Muslims who exhibit a range of beliefs and practices that reflect the diverse ethnic composition of the country's population. These Muslims are both impacted by local customs and laws governing religion and connected to other places in the world that influence their practice and experiences of religious belonging. In this entry, I provide a general introduction to how religion figures into the lives of middle-class migrant Muslims in the UAE. \n\nRather than focus on Emirati citizens, I look at noncitizen residents who have made the UAE their home. This entry is not focused on the working classes of the UAE, employed in sectors like construction or domestic work, nor the ultra-rich, but on migrant Muslims who fall in between the ends of such a spectrumâ the people who constitute the UAEâs teachers, doctors, engineers, and business men and women. These men and women are literate, which gives them greater direct access to religious knowledge, and they are educated professionals, which holds implications for their taste and interests in Islam.\n\nWhile these middle-class migrant Muslims can be mapped across many theological categories, those considered in this entry would generally be categorized as Sunni Muslim. Despite that, their beliefs and practices extend from Salafi inclined, literalist readings of the Quran, hadith, and Islamic tradition to Sufi oriented practitioners who privilege the interior over the exterior.\nWhat characterizes this religious group is their existence and practice of Islam in a state that is not their own. \n\nThough their religious practice is governed by the UAE, these migrant Muslims do not have a more permanent claim to a long-term presence there. Moreover, they have connections to other places around the worldâother religious scholars, sources of authority, and communitiesâthat play a role in their experience of Islam. It is the process of navigating such different pulls that makes this group unique.\n\nAs middle-class migrant Muslims, they also have the literary abilities, language skills, technologies, time, and freedom which permits them to access religious knowledge quite independentlyâby turning directly to scholars online, published books, or attending Islamic classes in one or multiple languages. This capacity to engage an array of Islamic knowledge introduces them to a range of beliefs and practices in the UAE that they likely would not have had access to in their countries of origin. Such particularities hold implications for how they proceed to embrace their faith.",

    "description": "Unlike Great Britain and Continental Europe, for which almost everything we know about the pre-Christian religion of the Celtic-speaking peoples comes from either Classical writers or archaeology, Ireland provides us with an abundance of medieval vernacular literature purporting to tell us about the pre-Christian period.  Indeed, the religion of the Irish Iron Age survived to varying degrees well after the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE.  Also unlike the Celtic cultures of Britain and the Continent, where the traditional learned class was systematically attacked and suppressed by the Romans, the pre-Christian Irish had a learned class that continued to flourish, maintaining oral historical records, overseeing the legal and educational systems, and carrying out a variety of religious functions.  It is to this learned class that we owe most of our knowledge of the old religion, as their educational system made heavy use of memorization of verse and prose stories, which were thus originally pedagogical, meant to serve as mnemonic devices to help in remembering other knowledge.  These included information about not only the religion but also the natural world, history, proper behavior, and much else.  Because they played a key role in the educational system, they were designed to also be entertaining and thus more easily remembered.  It is probably because of its pedagogical role that this oral material was eventually preserved, written down by scribes based in the Christian monasteries despite its rich pagan content.  Nonetheless, this preservation appears to have been selective, as the scribes would have been inclined to minimize those elements involving the older faith.  The manuscript literature thus provides us with information about many of the deities (Tuatha DÃ©), but it provides little information on specific beliefs or rituals, although much in the new religion appears to have been compatible with the old.  It has even been suggested that Christianity first gained a foothold in Ireland through its acceptance by the younger members of the learned class, who saw it as offering only a somewhat different perspective on their existing beliefs,   But as a result, the manuscript material must be used carefully as we cannot be certain that elements within it were not invented within the monasteries rather than reflecting true tradition.  A few things do seem clear.  The old religion and its gods were tied closely to the landscape and the annual agricultural cycle.  The gods occupied an invisible Otherworld closely paralleling our own.  And there was a strong belief in reincarnation.  So, to be fair, though there are many hints in the medieval manuscript literature, we really have almost no direct evidence contemporary with the period in question that can provide us with unbiased information about the nature of the religion.  What I have presented here is, therefore, based on my personal evaluation of these early manuscript materials and a scattering of other evidence.  Other scholars may well disagree with my interpretations, as I tend to assume more continuity in beliefs than some others do.  For an in-depth discussion of the issues and difficulties in using this material to reconstruct the pre-Christian religion, see Williams (2016)",

    "description": "This entry examines evidence pertaining to pre-Christian belief in Britain from the region around the Forth / Clyde line northwards, as well as the northern and western Isles. The focus is on historical pagan, pre-Christian northern Britain, which was a region of Iron Age Europe inhabited by Celtic language speaking tribes. During the early medieval era it was sometimes referred to as Pictland, and at the end of the time period in question it was renamed Scotland. The tribes of the region spoke a P-Celtic language (with some affinities to Gaulish, and later, to Welsh, Cornish and Breton), which was supplanted by a Q-Celtic language (Gaelic) brought in by Irish settlers in the 5th-6th centuries.\n\nThe region encompasses 30,081 square miles (80, 240 square kilometers), and is situated in close proximity to southern Britain (with which it shared some aspects of language and culture), as well as nearby Ireland, the Isle of Man, and parts of northern and Continental Europe.\n\nPrior to the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE, the people of the region did not create written records using an alphabetic system. However, in some parts of the region, starting in the 3rd-4th centuries, a unique system of pictographic symbols was developed and inscribed on stones and metalwork. This system is ascribed to the Picts, who emerge into the historical record through the writings of Classical and other European commentators. \n\nThe Pictish symbols consisted of animals, birds and fish, as well as 'abstract' symbols whose meanings are not known. Combinations of these symbols may have denoted personal or social identities, tribal boundaries or territory markers, or memorial sites. It is postulated that the Picts may have tattooed these symbols on their skin. \n\nBecause of the lack of contemporary native written source materials, much of our knowledge of the region is obtained through archaeology (especially before written accounts of the Picts).\n\nIron Age northern Britain appears to have been inhabited by a number of tribes, each likely ruled by a king or chieftain to whom the people owed their loyalty. In addition to kings and nobles, there were learned professions such as the druid, bard, harpist, and various types of skilled craftspeople. The region contained numerous small farmsteads focused on the production of cereal crops and other plant foods and resources, as well as the herding of livestock. \n\nIn addition to archaeology, useful comparisons pertaining to culture and religion have been made with other Iron Age Celtic-speaking cultures in southern Britain, Ireland, Gaul, and other parts ofÂ  Continental Europe. The pagan religion(s) of pre-Christian Iron Age northern Britain appears to have consisted of polytheism, with the possibility of animism as well. \n\nEvidence relating to native religion includes archaeological data pertaining to the location, layout and orientation of domestic dwellings, as well as votive offerings and depositions, and burial practices. Some useful comparisons may be made through informed analysis of ethnographic accounts relating to Gaulish religion and belief, including the training and functions of the Druidic class of religious specialists.\n\nLinguistic analysis and comparisons of place-names, personal names, theonyms, and socio-religious terminology from the region (and other Celtic regions) has proven fruitful, as has examination of possible parallels with religious themes and symbolism in early medieval written sources from southern Britain, Ireland and Continental Europe. \n\nFrom the available evidence we can discern a vibrant pagan culture in Iron Age northern Britain, whose people participated in domestic rituals and may also have attended socio-religious gatherings at local or tribal assembly sites. Depositions of votive offerings were made into ritual shafts or pits, caves, and bodies of water (wells, rivers, lakes, bogs), as well as in or near habitations or settlements. \n\nAs in many traditional cultures, religion would have infused nearly every aspect of daily life, and archaeological work has focused on the interconnection between local settlements, possible religious enclosures, and the landscape, including the presence of cosmological elements. \n\nIn addition to archaeology, early medieval Irish and Welsh literature may be\npotential sources of comparative information, if used judiciously. While written down after the introduction of Christianity, there are materials pertaining to social organization and legal systems, and aspects of sagas and traditional tales that highlight valued qualities such as truth, wisdom, honesty, loyalty and courage, as well as music, eloquence, poetry and skill. \n\nIn addition, there are numerous sagas, poems, mythic narratives, and onomastic tales that involve druids, deities, supernatural beings, and interactions between humans and the Otherworld realms. While there is considerable scholarly debate about this body of literature and what pre-Christian material it contains or reflects, the sheer volume of it - and the amount of material pertaining to beings expressly described as gods or goddesses (as well as other mythological or visionary material and themes) - must all be acknowledged, but also interpreted with care and discernment. \n\nAccording to the literature, there appear to have been numerous Celtic deities whose attributes were associated with aspects of culture (healing, prosperity, warfare, magic, horsemanship, food and drink, arts, crafts, seership and fertility) as well as those with associations with aspects of the natural world (rivers, wells, trees, groves, animals, birds and fish). Epigraphy and iconography from Britain and Gaul during the Roman era may also shed some light on the names and attributes of northern British divinities. \n\nIt should be noted that historical northern British / Pictish / Scottish paganism was not solely (or perhaps even primarily) an \"earth religion,\" as that term is commonly understood in the 21st century. In the various Celtic regions, the attributes of deities are highly concerned with culture, as well as nature. \n\nWhat is extremely prevalent in the archaeological evidence and the literary sources is a focus on interactions and relationships between human beings and the divine, whether that pertains to deities, ancestors and / or the Otherworld realms.\n\nIf written accounts and the literature reflect any semblance of earlier cultural beliefs and practices, it is reasonable to suggest that religious ceremonies would have been presided over by members of a highly-trained Druidic class. In Irish, southern British, and Continental written sources, the Druids of history were described as ritualists, jurists, arbitrators, moral and natural philosophers, and experts in the nature of (and communication with) the divine. They appear to have also provided counsel to leaders, performed divination, and engaged in healing rituals. In addition, they served as instructors to druidic candidates over a period of many years, and this training involved a great deal of memorization, as this was an orally transmitted culture. \n\nIn Gaul, the Druids apparently taught the people that the soul was immortal and after death would enter another body, and that the people should \"honour the Gods, do no ill deed, and practice valour.\" Early Irish literature provides examples of similar concepts, and much else besides. \n\nWhile the debate over the content of the literary sources was in recent memory stalled in a stand-off over 'nativist' and 'non-nativist' stances, in more recent times Celtic Studies has moved forward towards more refined approaches. \n\nBy engaging with each text in a nuanced and informed manner, and incorporating useful data from interdisciplinary and comparative methodologies, researchers have the potential to further illuminate the religious beliefs and practices of Iron Age and early medieval pagan northern Britain. Recent developments in regards to archaeological work and interpretive approaches are refining and transforming insights into variations in local and regional practices and beliefs. \n\nIt is important to note that the historically documented training and practices of the Druids in Celtic-speaking regions of Iron Age Europe have little or nothing to do with modern Neo-Pagan druidism or druidry, which are recent occult-based, earth-honoring religions developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.",

Encompassing 32,595 square miles, it is situated in close proximity to Britain and the Isle of Man, as well asÂ parts of Continental Europe. \n\nPrior to the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE, the people of Ireland did not typically create written records of any size. A system of writing known as Ogam was designed specifically for the Irish language (an early form referred to as Primitive Irish), created sometime between the late 4th - early 5th centuries, probably in south-west Ireland.

Whether repairing tracks on the long stretches of the Canadian or Northern Pacific railways, feeding logs into the screaming rotary saws of the lumber-mills, picking fruit in the luxuriant orchards or sunny hillsides of California, the twisted turban shows white or brilliant, a strange, exotic thing in the western landscape.â\nAs decades went by, Sikhsâ mentality about Sikhism adapted. By the mid-1940s, Sikhs at Stockton Gurdwara introduced chairs inside the gurdwara, so worshippers were not required to sit on the floor. The community even dropped the requirements for people to remove their shoes and cover their heads when they enter the gurdwara. If one was to walk inside Stockton Gurdwara, the physical space would resemble the inside of a church more than a gurdwara. Bruce LaBrack notes that this is âbecause they were better educated and more at ease in the American culture milieu [and] began to question some of the practices associated with Sikh Worship.â Sikh practices were classified by Sikhs of this time as âbackward and unnecessarily strict interpretations of gurdwara etiquette,â which is completely different than the terminology and spirit of the first wave of immigrants. With the Immigration Act of 1965 allowing more Sikhs to immigrate to the United States, Sikhism reverted back to its more traditional form. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Sikhs have been victims of hate crimes throughout the United States mainly due to two things: the color of their skin and their turbans. As a matter of fact, the first victim of a hate crime in the aftermath of 9/11 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh. Despite the struggle they face in America, Sikhs remain resilient. Today, the number of Sikhs in the United States has grown to over 500,000 with a number of new non-Punjabi converts joining the faith â mainly through the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO) started by Harbhajan Singh also known as âYogi Bhajan.â Throughout the entire history of Sikhs in the United States, their faith continues to be a key component. This section will look at Sikhism in the United States from when they first immigrated in 1899 to the present day.",

    "description": "Gaul was a large region of Iron Age Europe inhabited by Celtic language speaking tribes. Encompassing 191,000 square miles, it included what would become France, Luxembourg and Belgium, and parts of Switzerland, northern Italy, the Netherlands and Germany (particularly the west bank of the Rhine).\n\nPrior to the Roman conquest in 51 BCE, the people of Gaul did not typically create written records of any size. As a result, much of our knowledge of the region is obtained through archaeology, including the names of tribal leaders and native imagery found on Gaulish coins. \n\nThis is augmented by detailed (but not always reliable) written accounts by Julius Caesar and other Classical commentators. In addition, useful comparisons pertaining to culture and religion have been made with other Celtic-speaking cultures in Britain, Ireland and Galatia (Asia Minor). \n\nPre-Roman Gaul consisted of a large number of tribes or chiefdoms whose economy was based on herding and agriculture, as well as trade. The religion of pre-Roman pagan Gaul consisted of polytheism, with the possibility of animism as well. Our main evidence includes archaeological data pertaining to the location, layout and orientation of ritual sites, votive offerings and depositions, and burial practices, as well as informed analysis of ethnographic accounts of Gaulish religion and belief, including the training and functions of the Druidic class of religious specialists. \n\nIn addition, some elements of Roman era epigraphy and iconography may shed light on native belief, particularly in regard to Gaulish gods and goddessesÂ and their attributes. Linguistic analysis and comparisons of place-names, personal names, theonyms, and socio-religious terminology from other Celtic regions has proven fruitful, as has examination of possible parallels with religious themes and symbolism from early medieval Irish and British written sources. \n\nFrom the available evidence we can discern a vibrant culture in Gaul, whose people were described as wearing stunning brightly coloured clothing and many gold and bronze ornaments, and who were skilled metalworkers, horsemen, mariners and artisans. They valued truth, wisdom, honesty and courage, as well as music, eloquence, poetry and skill.\n\nAs in many traditional cultures, religion infused nearly every aspect of daily life, and recent archaeological work has focused on the interconnection between religious spaces and dwellings or settlements. There appear to have been numerous Gaulish deities, whose attributes were associated with aspects of culture (healing, prosperity, warfare, magic, horsemanship, food and drink, arts and fertility) as well as those whose names reflect aspects of the natural world (rivers, wells, trees, groves, animals and birds).\n \nReligious ceremonies were presided over by members of the highly-trained Druidic class, who also served in a judicial capacity. They were described as highly skilled arbitrators, moral and natural philosophers, and experts in the nature of (and communication with) the divine. The Druids appear to have also provided counsel to leaders, performed divination and engaged in healing rituals. \n\nThey served as instructors to druidic candidates over a period of many years, and this training involved an immense amount of memorization, as this was an oral culture. The Druids apparently taught the people that the soul was immortal and after death would enter another body, and that the people should \"honour the Gods, do no ill deed, and practice valour.\" \n\nIt is important to note that the historically documented training and practices of the Druids in Celtic-speaking regions of Iron Age Europe have little or nothing to do with modern Neo-Pagan druidism or druidry, which are recent occult-based, earth-honoring religions developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.",

    "description": "\"Gaiwiio,\" \"The Way of Handsome Lake,\" or simply \"The Good Message,\" is a new religious movement that emerged among the Seneca tribe of present-day northeastern U.S in the early 19th century. It combined moral and theological elements of Protestant Christianity (especially Quakerism) with Iroquois rituals and cosmology. The founder of the movement, Handsome Lake (1735-1815), was from the Seneca tribe--one of the six great nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (1722-1867). The movement, popularly referred to as \"Longhouse Religion,\" remains active today.\n\nIn 1799 Handsome Lake, brother to the Seneca war chief Cornplanter, experienced a vision while in a fevered state. This vision marked the beginning of the Gaiwiio religion. While laying bedbound, Handsome Lake pondered the misfortune of his tribe. The Seneca, once a proud Iroquois Nation, had become a broken people during the burgeoning expansion of a young America. Poverty and alcoholism, in particular, had laid waste to his people. As he drifted into sleep, he was visited by three spirits, which made him well again and, additionally, bestowed upon him a message from the Great Creator and commanded him to spread the instruction among his people. \n\nThe Next day, at the Strawberry Festival, a healthy Handsome Lake conveyed this divinely delivered message to all who had attended. The message primarily contained instructions from the Creator on how to order society on earth. It preached against four \"words\" or evils which the people were to avoid: whiskey, witchcraft, love-magic, and abortion or sterility. Those guilty of these acts must repent to Handsome Lake, or, if the transgression was severe enough, to the Creator. From accounts taken by Quakers at the Strawberry festival, we know that this message was well received and that one could \"feel the weight of the Spirit\" and \"the love of God\" present and flowing among the audience (Wallace 1969, 242). \n\nIn the years to come (1799-1801), Handsome Lake would have new visions sent to him by spirits sent on behalf of the Creator. The second essential vision set out an apocalyptic theology for the followers of Handsome Lake. In it, he saw the death of the earth and the eternal fate of the wicked and the good. The sinful suffered at the hands of the Tormentor (or Punisher), while the righteous reunited with the Great Spirit in the Heaven World. A third vision instructed Handsome Lake to spread his Gospel to all Indians. Thus at the end of these three visions, Gaiwiio had its essential form. It was concerned with living righteously on earth for the sake of eternity, fascinated with the inevitable destruction of the planet, and aimed to convert as many Indians as possible to its ranks.",

    "description": "One of the three primary sects in Second Temple Judaism (alongside the Pharisees and Essenes). The Sadducees are primarily known as being comprised of the social elites, many of whom were part of the priestly society of Jerusalem. The Sadducees that fit this description were heavily involved in political and religious affairs, including the oversight of the temple. Sadducees, however, were also found outside of Jerusalem in the region of ancient Palestine and included Jews of every social class. The only known shared belief among all Sadducees is the determination for a return of the priestly dynasty. The Sadducee's demise is frequently tied to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans in 70 CE, though it is likely that Jews continued to identify with the group even after this event.\nThe name Sadducee and the origins of the movement are still cloaked in uncertainty. Scholars believe that linguistically the name Sadducee is derived from one of two Hebrew origins. While some propose that the term is related to the Hebrew term tzaddik (ârighteousâ) and provides context to the movements beliefs, others connect the term to the figure Zadok, the high priest in the days of David and Solomon and argue that the group is in some way connected to a priestly lineage. Although these explanations have been held up as insights into the origins of the Jewish sect and have been used to hint at the early history of the group, there is not enough primary information available to know for certain if there is any tie between the name and the movementâs history. References to Sadducees first appear in the literature of the Hasmonaean period, but there is no definitive history of the sect, though some posit that the elitism of the sect has its origins in earlier periods.\nMany of the perceived insights into the Sadducees (close connection with outside rulers, highly Hellenized, etc.) stem from equating elitism with various aspects of culture and society in the late Second Temple period. These conclusions, however, are largely erroneous as the primary source material describing the Sadducees is very limited. Most of the information about the Sadducees aligns with the beliefs and practices of Second Temple Judaism, while distinctive characteristics are derived from what is said about them in the Greek New Testament and what is preserved in the writings of Josephus. Later Christian commentators rely exclusively upon these sources in their discussions of the Jewish sect. Additional information can be gleaned from Tannaitic references that highlight arguments between the tsadukim (likely the Sadducees) and perushim (likely the Pharisees). Ultimately, we have to be cautious and follow the statement of Lawrence Schiffman who stated, \"the views of the Pharisees and Sadducees must remain shrouded in mystery.\"",

    "description": "This entry is aimed to document the religious beliefs and activities of Xuanzang and his major dharma heirs. Xuanzang (intentionally or subconsciously) established the \"YogÄcÄra\" tradition, which he deemed as the genuine form of MahÄyÄna Buddhism, in China. \n\nXuanzang is one of the most famous pilgrims in world history who took an arduous journey to India, studied at the Nalanda Monastery, and introduced thousands of Buddhist scriptures to China. After returning from India, Xuanzang accompanied the Emperor Taizong of Tang for a period of time. Later, with the royal patronage, he initiated mass translation projects and thus also renowned as one of the âFour Greatest Chinese Buddhist translators.â\n\nWithin his translation teams, a few members became his intimate disciples, e.g. Kuiji, Woncheuk and Puguang. They carried and developed Xuanzangâs teaching and wrote many commentaries to explain this sophisticated scholastic Buddhist tradition. As a request received from Kuiji, Xuanzang, based on the works of the ten greatest YogÄcÄra commentators at the Nalanda Monastery, manufactured the classic compendium Cheng weishi lun, which later became the most seminal text not only for the whole YogÄcÄra tradition but also for the whole Chinese Buddhism tradition. \n\nDespite its particularity, this tradition is far from institutionalized and only bonded by their doctrinal proclivities. Societally speaking, this tradition did not last more than a century. Its cradle place, the Great Ciâen Temple, soon became Tantric-focused. The tradition neither has a patriarchal system by itself nor provide a clear dharma-transmission narrative. After two generations, the number of commentaries gradually diminished. Since then, this strand of YogÄcÄra thoughts is fully dismantled into Chinese Buddhist traditions, such as Chan and Huayan. Along with four major and minor transmission, this tradition is transmitted into Japan and became fully sectarianized as the HossÅ sect, which remained as one of the strongest Buddhist sects in Japan.\n \nThis idiosyncratic tradition offers a set of unique doctrines, such as \"eight consciousnesses and four aspects\" and âthree natures,â which represents the Abhidharmic psychological wing of YogÄcÄra Buddhism. It offers a unique soteriological path by analyzing oneâs cognitive process and subsequently acquire the divine cognition to perceive the âtrue natureâ (buddha-nature, so-to-speak) of existence. The title of Xuanzangâs compendium expresses the central idea of this traditionââmerely consciousness.â  Its philosophy draws a similarity with Kantian Transcendental Idealism, which asserts the world we human perceived is bonded by our epistemological limit and supported by a transcendental cognito, and Husserlian Phenomenology, which suspends the ontological inquiry and shifts to study and propose a universal cognitive structure that we human perceive experience. And therefore, nowadays, this tradition is commonly rendered as the Buddhist phenomenology, which contributed enormously to modern scientific disciplines, e.g. cognitive science, psychology, and science of mind.",

    "description": "SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji (æ¡æ¸¯å¯º) is a SÅtÅ Zen Buddhist temple located in San Francisco's Japantown. Founded on 8 December 1934 by Reverend Isobe HÐ¾Ìsen (ç£¯é¨å³°ä»), SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji is arguably one of the most historically significant Zen Buddhist institutions in the United States. In addition to serving the religious and cultural needs of the Japanese American community in the Bay Area for over 85 years, SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji is the point of origin for many SÅtÅ Zen lineages in the U.S. The templeâs original location, a former synagogue at 1881 Bush Street, was purchased in 1934 by Teruo Kasuga. Over the next two decades, SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìjiâs Japanese American congregation survived incarceration during World War IIâat which time they continued to make payments on the temple buildingâand anti-Japanese racism post-war. In 1959, Suzuki ShunryÅ« (é´æ¨ä¿é) was appointed SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìjiâs sixth head priest. After gathering a large following of predominantly white and non-Japanese disciples, Suzuki resigned from his position in 1969 and founded the San Francisco Zen Center (Hosshinji çºå¿å¯º) and Tassajara Zen Mountain Center (Zenshinji ç¦å¿å¯º). Many of Suzukiâs students have become Zen teachers in their own right, such as Reb Anderson, Jakusho Kwong, and Mel Weitsman. SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji has also been home to several associate priests (æå±å§ä¾¶) who went on to train students of their own or become important voices for Zen in the U.S., including KatÅ Wako (å æ»åå), Chino KÅbun (ç¥éå¼æ), and Katagiri Dainin (çæ¡å¤§å¿). Katagiri in particular, who was assigned to assist Suzuki in the 1960s, founded the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center (GanshÅji é¡çå¯º) in 1972 and was key propagating SÅtÅ Zen Buddhism in the American Midwest. In 1980, construction began on a new building for SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji at 1691 Laguna Street, which was completed in 1984 and has been its home since. SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji continues to be a valued institution in the Japantown community. It offers private services (weddings, funerals, memorials, etc.), monthly services, and annual services such as the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes (higan å½¼å²¸), Hanamatsuri (è±ç¥­ã), and Obon (ãç). SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji also hosts a martial arts school, sutra-copying classes, tea ceremony courses, and is an avid participant in Japantownâs annual Cherry Blossom Festival. Finally, SÐ¾ÌkÐ¾Ìji has an active zazenkai (åº§ç¦ä¼) or zazen meditation group that meets several times a week and holds occasional multi-day practice intensives (sesshin æ¥å¿).",

    "description": "The Bnay QyÄmÄ and BnÄt QyÄmÄ (\"Sons of the Covenant\" and \"Daughters of the Covenant\" respectively) were Syriac Christian ascetics first attested in the fourth century CE. These individuals, sworn to an ascetic and celibate life, served public and liturgical functions within Syriac churches and communities. Evidence of their activities survives in remarks in a variety of religious treatises and hagiographical texts as well as rules promulgated by religious leaders. This article summarizes the known origins, social significance, and ecclesiastical functions of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ.\n\n\nThe precise social and linguistic origins of the designation are debated. The noun often translated âcovenantâ (qyÄmÄ) derives from the root qwm (âto standâ), and it has a wide range of meanings, including status, station, oath, and contract. Robert Murray has suggested an origin for the term in baptismal rites, where the catechumen took a proverbial âstandâ and rose from the waters (Murray 1974/5). According to another view, the related noun for âresurrectionâ (qyÄmtÄ) may have played a role in this use of bnay qyÄmÄ (cf. Luke 20:36). Finally, M.R. Macina has argued that the term related to Greek kanon and tentatively proposed that the bnay qyÄmÄ â âmembers of the [church] institutionâ â were more integrated into the clerical hierarchy (Macina 1999).\n\n\nIf we are to believe fourth and fifth-century martyr narratives which claim that children of the covenant were targeted in the persecutions of Diocletian and Shapur II, âcovenantersâ probably existed as pre-monastic ascetic movement in the third century (Harvey 2005, 126). The most important early source is Aphrahatâs sixth demonstration which dates to around 336/7 and describes the renunciatory ideal of the bnay qyÄmÄ. His text, replete with military and athletic imagery, exhorts the children of the covenant to reject the refinements and attachments of the world and instead embrace a spiritual marriage with Christ.\n\n\nAside from passing references to the group in hagiographies and church histories, most of our knowledge of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ derives from lists of canons, most notably the rules attributed to Rabbula, bishop of Edessa in 411-32 (see Phenix and Horn 2017), but also in canons attributed to Maruta of Maipherqat in the fifth-century and John of Tella in the sixth-century (see VÃ¶Ã¶bus 1975 and 1982). These rules prescribe communal and celibate living, either with ones family or with fellow children of the covenant (of the same sex). It can be inferred that vows of poverty were not required based on their prohibition from usury and exemption from collections from priests. Clothing was to be uniform and modest, and outside business and legal entanglements were not allowed. Prayer and fasting were their primary responsibilities, but they also cared for church administration, the staffing of hospitals, and the care of the poor.\n\n\nOne feature of the âcovenantersâ which distinguishes them from later monastic communities in the west was their central role in public liturgical singing. The bnÄt qyÄmÄ were particularly unique in this regard (on which, see Harvey 2005). The fifteenth canon of the synod of Phrygian Laodicea restricted singing in church to these women. According to Jacob of Sarug, Ephrem the Syrian (late 4th c.) established a choir of women to sing his hymns. In this role, they embodied and taught the eschatological and soteriological ideals of the wider religious community. \n\n\nBy the medieval period the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ had declined in importance. On the one hand, the bnÄt qyÄmÄ became assimilated with deaconesses and nuns. On the other hand, bnay qyÄmÄ were eclipsed by both clerics within the ecclesiastic hierarchy and cenobitic monks. Aside from a smattering of literary references, the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ had largely disappeared by the tenth century.\n\nThe geographic extent of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ was much broader than the region marked here, namely the Roman province of Osroene in the fifth century, which was chosen both for the sake of simplicity and due to the importance of Edessa as a cultural and religious center. Syriac Christianity and the institution of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ certainly extended into other provinces of the Roman empire and the Persian empire to the east.",

    "description": "American Evangelicalism is a subset of American Christianity that spans numerous denominational groups including Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Pentecostals among others. A theologically diverse movement, American Evangelicals are often recognized for their emphasis on revivalism and personal religious conversion. The movement lacks a centralized institutional leader, but diverse local, regional, and national networks help reinforce religious authority. \n\nAmerican Evangelical beginnings can be traced back to the early eighteenth century when a series of religious revivals took place in colonial New England. Preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield along with lay leaders like Sarah Osborn preached a version of Christianity that prioritized a personal conversion experience in which individuals became assured of their salvation. By privileging an individual experience, evangelical adherents gained the power to proclaim their faith in God giving some scholars the impression that the movement âdemocratizedâ Christianity. While individuals may have gained some authority through this emphasis on a personal religious experience, an individualâs community functioned to help evaluate and verify whether experiences were genuine. \n\nRevivals and worship services that seek to encourage a conversion experience have been hallmarks of the American Evangelical movement. These large events include singing hymns and preaching and could take place either in a church or outside as with the Cane Ridge Reveal of 1801. Individuals like Dwight Moody, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson carried this revivalistic tradition into the twentieth century. Today, large Mega Churches like Saddleback Church in California effectively turn Sunday worship services into large revivalistic events. Not all American Evangelical churches are large, however, and many have no more than a couple hundred members.\n\nAmerican Evangelicals are incredibly effective institution builders, utilizing technological innovation, print culture, higher education, and marketing tactics to attract new members as well as shape and reinforce their identity. From organizations like the American Tract Society to evangelical Colleges and Universities, American Evangelicals have been successful through constructing institutions and accruing wealth as a result of these institutions. \n\nCoupled with their institution building, American Evangelicals are also politically active. In the nineteenth century this political activism took the form of moral reform societies, and by the twentieth century, evangelical political activism became more intensely wedded to partisan politics. In 1976, the magazine Newsweek declared it the âYear of the Evangelicalâ spurred in large part to the election of President Jimmy Carter, a self described âBorn Again,â evangelical Christian. American Evangelicals continued to exercise significant political influence in American political life well into the twenty-first century, and overwhelmingly supported the election of Donald Trump in 2016.",

    "description": "In order to classify Tibetan Buddhism, genuine classification principles have to be applied, e.g. according to the monasteries in which certain schools of Tibetan Buddhism were established, or on the basis of the name of the master to whom a particular school of Tibetan Buddhism is attributed, or according to the preferred spiritual and cultural background of a particular master.\n\nThe school is named after the Sakya Buddhist monastery founded in 1073 by KhÃ¶n KÃ¶nchog Gyelpo (1034-1102), which is located in Sakya and was called Sakya Densa (sa skya gdan sa) or Sakya GÃ¶npa (sa skya dgon pa) in Tibet.\n\nThe history and teachings of the Sa skya pa school are based on the following \"five greats\":\nKun dga' snyin po (1092-1158), whose studies were mainly devoted to the cycle around Hevajra, the tutelary deity of the Sa skya pa himself. \nBsod nams rtse mo (1142-1182) worked towards a systematic order and classification of tantric scriptures and also provided summaries of the teachings. \nRje btsun Grags pa rgyal mtshan (1147-1216) is the author of numerous works of tantric and dogmatic exegetic and even medical treatises. \nSa skya Pandita (1182-1231), based on the PramÄá¹avÄrttika of Dharmakirti, turned his attention mainly to problems of dogmatics and logic; he was also interested in rhetoric. \nThe last in this series, 'Phags pa (1235-1280?), an extremely prolific writer who wrote all kinds of dogmatic, tantric and liturgical subjects, he also addressed numerous letters to Mongolian princes, in which he summarised the basic elements of the Buddhist teaching.",

    "description": "German Protestantism of the 18th and 19th century, mainly in the Lutheran tradition, was a crucible for widely disseminated theology that continues to influence contemporary Christianity. This period was entrenched within the Enlightenment, and very consciously so. The efforts to systematize theological views and biblical interpretation within the new paradigms of scientific progress and Rationalism greatly influenced both institutional and personal piety in this period. The birth of biblical studies within academic institutions was also developed in this period. Particularly, scholars of theology began applying socio-historical criticism to the Bible in ways that drove the theological debates among the elites. As in many societies, elite discourse did not necessarily affect the day-to-day of practitioners immediately, but many of the developments within the academy did find themselves disseminated broadly, particularly as culminated in the popular works of Adolf Harnack at the end of the 19th century.\nFor most practitioners, their attentions would have been less on the academic debates and more on their immediate socio-political environment. Germany in the 19th century saw many revolutions, such as that of Napoleon Bonaparte, the end of constitutional monarchy of 1919, the revolutions of 1848-1849 (MÃ¤rzrevolution), the rise of the German Empire, and the industrial revolution, the latter making Germany one of the most powerful nations in Europe. The population grew greatly in this new democracy, creating new opportunities and challenges in itself. Thinkers like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) and Karl Marx (1818-1883) greatly influenced the political landscape and fueled ideologies of revolution.\nThe relationship between the Church and the State also changed greatly in this period. Frederick William III endeavored to unify the Protestant Church. Lutherans, Calivinists, and Reformed congregations made moves to merge their parrishes. Some, particularly the âOld Lutherans,â rejected such moves and emigrated elsewhere to avoid possible sanctions. The United States and Australia were popular destinations for these Lutherans, where they established the âMissouri Synodâ and the Lutheran Church of Australia, respectively.\nWhile many people surely went about their lives without notice of the paradigm shifts Germany was experiencing, the net effect of these changes shook the world on the economic, religious, and social levels. A full understanding of Protestant religion today and the formative events of the 20th century on European and American culture (particularly the World Wars), benefits from a comprehension of the 19th century Protestant developments which fed directly into the creation of modernity.",

    "description": "The Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as Christian Science, is an American Christian restorationist religion and healing tradition founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879. Christian Science is predicated on whatâs considered Eddyâs re-discovery of the divine healing ministry of Jesus Christ as an essential aspect of Christian life. After a lifetime of physical and mental suffering, Eddy founded Christian Science following a debilitating fall on the ice in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1866 referred to as the âFall in Lynnâ. During her period of recovery, she turned to the Bible for relief and later wrote her understanding of Jesusâ ministry in a text published in 1875 entitled Science and Health (later re-published as Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures). Eddy underscored the need for Christians to take part in healing both themselves and others and declared that the same works of healing demonstrated by Jesus were not miracles particular to his age but available to all Christians. Before writing Science and Health, Eddy was a student of New Thought leader Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. \n\nDuring the turn of the 20th century, Christian Science rapidly attracted followers across the United States and later in Europe and Australia. Eventually the religion would spread to Asia and Africa, where it now has experienced its greatest growth. The religious practice of Christian Science is based on study of the King James version of the Bible and a large corpus of writings authored by Mary Baker Eddy, especially her work Science and Health which is considered the textbook of Christian Science. \n\nIn lieu of clergy, Christian Scientists instead view the Bible and Science and Health as their only âPastor.â They are most well-known for engaging in healing by prayer rather than seeking allopathic medical care, although they are not forbidden as members of the Church from seeking medical attention. Christian Scientists employ prayer for healing and also hire professional healers in Christian Science known as practitioners. Christian Scientists are called to engage in the healing work of Jesus Christ by healing themselves and others through prayer alone. This prayer involves an understanding of God as Perfect Spirit and man as Godâs perfect creation. Reality is interpreted as strictly metaphysical or Divine Spirit, and consequently, disease and matter are dismissed as unreal and lacking in âintelligenceâ and power. Christian Scientists interpret disease as the product of fear or erroneous thinking referred to as âmortal mindâ and dismiss epidemiological interpretations of illness and contagion.\n\nIn the United States, members of the Church of Christ, Scientist have historically labored through lobbying and other means of political redress to maintain what they consider their religious freedom to opt for care under a Christian Science practitioner or healer rather than seeking medical attention. Christian Science has therefore been influential in shaping the United Statesâ legal interpretation of religious freedom. Christian Scientists have been implicated in charges of child neglect and abuse in legal cases in which Christian Science parents opted to heal their children through prayer rather than seeking medical attention. Highly-publicized cases of this nature in the late 20th century brought significant negative attention to Christian Science.\n\nThe Christian Science church is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and is known as the Mother Church. It is also the home of the Christian Science Publishing Society where the Christian Science Monitor, an internationally-recognized periodical, is published. The Church also publishes the Christian Science Journal and the Christian Science Sentinel. Both publications contain public testimonies of Christian Science healing. Christian Science churches hold two services each week, one on Sunday and another on Wednesday. Each is led by two readers, or appointed members of branch churches who read from both the King James Bible and Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. The Wednesday service includes public testimony of healings. In addition to Christian Science branch churches, Christian Science Reading Rooms are operated in conjunction with each church as a âpublic faceâ to the religion and offer a place where members and non-members can access and purchase Christian Science literature. Reading Rooms are operated by Christian Science branch church volunteers. \n\nChristian Science is considered a âscienceâ or âdivine scienceâ in that the religionâs efficacy regarding healing is understood as demonstrable and repeatable. Christian Scientists additionally understand their faith as adhering to divine laws that supersede natural laws. When Eddy adopted the term science in the late 19th century, the term was in wider circulation and had broader connotations than today.",

These concerns have historically taken hold when linked to the project of reinstilling lost manhood, of fixing \"overcivilized\" and effeminate men through right orientation to divine, gendered purpose. Aligned toward personal \"instinct\" and God-given knowledge of best health and fitness practices, the movement is predominantly protestant-inspired. As a means of social reform - of sanitizing sport culture from various evil influences, of offering healthy alternatives to unhealthy societal norms around diet, dress, medicine, or daily comportment - Muscular Christianity has resonated in Catholic, Jewish, and more broadly \"secular\" circles as well.",

Both Luangda Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah have continued the forest tradition through their disciples, in both Thailand and international countries- primarily the West.

Mundurucu villages are autonomous, but come together for activities such as warfare and important ceremonies. Most Mundurucu villages have at least one religious specialist, known as a shaman, who has a close connection to the supernatural world and is the only individual capable of communicating with supernatural beings. The three categories of supernatural beings are souls of the dead, various malignant/mischievous beings, and the spirit mothers of game animals. The most important category is the spirit mothers of game animals, which include the generic spirit mother of all game animals, as well as specific mothers of various species. These spirit mothers are propitiated through ceremonies (led by shamen) in order to maintain the well-being of the community. For the Mundurucu, religion permeates most aspects of life.

This entry focuses on the native belief system of those living in the village and environs of Rengsanggri around the time of 1955. At this time, the village of Rengsanggri contained sixty households (about 300 individuals), making it one of the largest Garo villages. Every Garo is a member of one of five exogamous matrilineal descent groups, which are each divided into numerous subdivisions (Burling, 1963). The household is the primary unit of production, consumption, and daily life. The nokma or headman acts as the ceremonial leader of the village but does not have much authority outside ceremonial responsibilities. Supernatural beings include meâmang (ghosts) and mites. Mite is a general term for supernatural beings and encompasses gods and other spirits.

    "description": "The Oneida Community was a 19th-century communal Christian Perfectionist utopian society founded and led by John Humphrey Noyes. Noyes, a radical socialist Christian preacher from Vermont, was expelled from Yale Divinity School and had his preaching license revoked for espousing Christian perfectionism. Noyes derived his understanding of Perfectionism from his revelation that the second advent of Christ had already occurredâalbeit in spiritual formâin 70CE during the destruction of the Temple. This advent of Christ had ushered in a spiritual period during which perfection among men and the absence of sin, as a reflection of heaven, was possible.  Noyes first gathered followers in Putney, Vermont but was soon chased out of that area for his radical beliefs and practices and later shifted his society to Oneida, New York. Noyesâ principal community of followers was then established as The Oneida Community, but satellite locations in Brooklyn, New York and Wallingford, Connecticut were also founded. The Oneida Community was comprised of several hundred men, women and children who lived together in a large house called the Mansion House and were united socially and spiritually under Noyes' understanding of Bible Communism derived from interpretations of the New Testament and Noyesâ perfectionist beliefs. The Oneida Community understood themselves to be living in a new Christian era where the human institutions of law, marriage and gender relations were superseded by spiritual laws and interpretations. In this vein, the adult members of the Oneida Community practiced a form of non-monogamy they termed Complex Marriage in which each adult was considered married to one another as a large spiritual family. Gender relations and occupations were more liberal than in the surrounding Victorian culture of America at the time. Oneida Community women were notable for having short hair and wearing bloomers or loose pants during a time when women's fashion generally prescribed long hair and long dresses. Procreation in the Community was at first strictly controlled through their practice of âmale continenceâ or coitus reservatus. Eventually, the Community engaged in a proto-eugenics experiment they called stirpiculture, which led to the planned conception, birth and communal rearing of 58 children. Community members engaged in communal labor, including agricultural work and community industries such as trap making. The Oneida Community eventually dissolved as a religious community due to internal disputes and was re-imagined as a secular joint-stock company most famous for its dish ware.",

    "description": "The Timbira are located in eastern South America and are comprised of about 15 tribes. This entry focuses on the Canela group living in Brazil (mainly in the state of MaranhÃ£o) around the time of 1915, prior to the reservation era beginning in the 1960âs. The name âCanelaâ includes the three adjacent but independent Timbira groups of KÃ©nkateye, ApÄ'nyekra, and RÄmkÅ'kamekra. The term Canella was originally used by settlers, and translates to cinnamon or shinbone in Portuguese; âCanelaâ is the modern term. Traditionally, the Canela lived in a large, circular village plan with houses all facing a central plaza. These villages historically contained up to 1,500 individuals, but the introduction of diseases in the 1800 has dramatically reduced the population (Crooker and Beierle, 2012). At the time this entry focuses on, the largest Canela group (the RÄmkÅ'kamekra) was comprised of about 230 people. Canela social units include the individual family, matrilineal extended family, matrilineal exogamous moieties (each includes half of the village), nonexogamous rainy season moieties, plaza groups, plaza moieties, age classes, age-class moieties, and six menâs societies. Note that these groupings are all within the village level. The village is led by a chief (paâhi) and a group of councilmen. Paâhi have minimal political control and serve primarily as peacemaker and ceremonial leaders. Ceremonies are important, but not necessarily religious in nature and are largely associated with the social and economic importance surrounding puberty rites and the calendrical cycle. Religion and beliefs about the supernatural do not play a significant role in Canela daily life. Supernatural beings (such as the sun and moon) and ghosts are present, but not described in substantial ethnographic details. Religious practitioners, referred to as medicine men or shamans, consult with spirits to cure illness and sometimes gain a âdisease substanceâ that can be used to afflict others. Religion does not exist within a distinct sphere of life for the Canela; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",

In 1835 the Chatham Islands were conquered by Maori from mainland New Zealand. As a result of their harsh treatment at the hands of the invaders, the Moriori suffered catastrophic demographic and cultural decline. Today, around 1000 New Zealanders claim Moriori descent, but little remains of Moriori culture.",

    "description": "Historically, the Comanche inhabited the southern Great Plains region of what is now the United States, including southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and western Texas (Gelo and Abate, 2009). This area was restricted with the 1865 Treaty of the Little Arkansas, which bound many Comanche to the Texas panhandle area, and later the Medicine Lodge Creek Treaty of 1867, which outlined a joint Kiowa-Comanche-Apache reservation in Oklahoma. However, many Comanche did not reside on reservations until forced to by an army campaign in 1874-1875. This entry focuses on the Comanche around the time of 1870, reconstructing life prior to the reservation era and consequent culture change. At this time, the Comanche lived in autonomous, nomadic bands, following the seasonal movements of the buffaloâa key source of subsistence and materials necessary for life on the plains. âThe Comanche band, or local group, ranged in size from a single family camping alone, through the small camp of related individuals who formed a composite extended family, up to the large band of several hundred personsâ (Hoebel, 1940:11). Band size changed depending on the season, with larger bands functioning as a unit only in the summer months. Regardless of size, each band (or local group) had a permanent leader, typically an individual who possessed great importance and ability. When bands came together in the summer, the leaders formed a council and selected one individual as leader for the season with the others serving as an advisory council. Generally, the Comanche religion was not a formal, communal matter as âthere was no religious organization, no theocracy, no priestly class, no dogmaâ (Wallace and Hoebel, 1952:155). However, religion remained an important aspect of Comanche life, and this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Comanche society. A high god known as the Great Spirit is described as an omniscient and omnipotent creator deity associated with the sun. The Great Spirit is generally otiose in nature, and acts through inferior spirits. The sun, Earth, and moon are also viewed as deities. Other supernatural beings include Thunderbird, spirits of the deceased, dwarf people, and guardian spirits. Vision quests are not mandatory, but most individuals participate. During a vision quest, individuals isolate themselves for several days, fasting and attempting to derive supernatural power (medicine) through âa mystic visitation, a dream phenomenon, or hallucinatory experienceâ (Wallace and Hoebel, 1952:155). In a successful vision quest, a guardian spirit will appear to an individual, often in the form of an animal, and transfer supernatural power. Although full-time religious practitioners are not present among the Comanche, individuals known as medicine men have acquired a large amount of supernatural powers (medicine), which can be used for curing, rainmaking, and divination.",

Another argues they were a group of former Cham people that fled into the uplands after a war with Äáº¡i Viá»t (15th century) and then resettled into uplands, midlands, and eventually, some lowland areas. The second argument is more pervasive in Vietnamese language academia and within the contemporary Hâroi community. Oral histories still circulate, tying the Hâroi to the refugees of the royal court of Vijaya, the ChampÄ polity that was conquered in 1471 CE by Äáº¡i Viá»t. The also state Hâroi had to adopt practices from neighboring ethnic groups to blend in and not be pursued by Äáº¡i Viá»t militaries. Therefore, their spiritual activities became quite similar to the Bahnaric groups, while retaining some Chamic (Ede, Churu, etc.) beliefs. Their language is also classified as a Bahnaric language by recent studies in historical linguistics. Regardless of the origins hypothesis, their roots seem to be in the ChampÄ civilization, followed by a period of becoming a distinct group (15th â 17th century), while assimilating into greater Bahnaric communities [perhaps âagain,â likely âfor the first timeâ] from the 15th â 20th century. Nonetheless, within Vietnam, they are considered on",

    "description": "Korean shamans are often denoted by the term mudang, which encompasses a variety of folk religion practitioners, and other kinds of spiritual consultants. While most Korean scholars, mass media, and public discourse apply mudang to both trance and non-trance practitioners, the terms mansin or kangsin-mu (god-descended mediators) more narrowly denote possessed practitioners. SesÅ­p-mu are hereditary practitioners; they do not assert that gods descend into them and were not ordained after sinbyÅng (spirit possession sickness). This kind of initial possession serves as a demonstration that the practitioner was chosen by supernatural entities to be their mediators with people. The term mudang can be applied to both kinds of practitioners because before modern urbanization, regional traditions used to be the main factor that determined which kind of mudang will be common in each place. Although hereditary shamans are not possessed, they still engage with and talk to spirits. Sometimes, they harness the help of a spirit medium who can deliver messages from spirits and gods, although she cannot perform full kut rituals on her own. Furthermore, the dances and songs of this received cultural tradition are significant in terms of artistry because they are learned for many years, sometimes from a very young age. Their artistry has been acknowledged by the South Korean government designation program, as has been also the case with several possessed practitioners, or mansin. Mansin means â10,000 spiritsâ and refers to the polytheistic nature of this possession-based folk religion.",

    "description": "The Lamet are native to the northwestern part of what is now known as Laos. This entry focuses on the Lamet living in this region around the time of 1940, and draws primarily from the work of principal ethnographic authority Karl Gustav Izikowitz. At the time Izikowitz was conducting field work among the Lamet (1936-1938), the region was governed by France, and was known as French Indochina. Despite being under French political rule, the Lamet culture was not greatly influenced by European culture. Each Lamet village is an independent unit, and no formal political office exists beyond the level of the village. However, the Lamet have seven totemic, patrilineal, exogamous clans that cut across villages and regulate marriage ties. The most important social unit is the house group, which is comprised of an extended family led by a housefather. Each village includes several house groups. There is somewhat of a hierarchy among the housefathers, with those who are lem (wealthiest) having greater influence within the village. The individual most closely resembling a chief is the xÇmiÄ (priest of sacrifice), whose authority varies in each village depending on personality and status. The xÇmiÄâs responsibilities include performing all sacrifices to the various spirits of the village, ensuring order is kept and the spirits are not disturbed, and supervising the community house. The position is hereditary in the male line. Religious ceremonies focus around hunting, agriculture and the seasonal cycle, death/burial rites, and maintaining the good will of spirits to ensure the wellbeing of the village. Lamet supernatural beings include village spirits, ancestor spirits (also known as house spirits), and forest spirits. Additionally, rice possess a spirit in the same way that a human possesses a soul. Medicine men are also present, and use divination to determine which spirit is causing illness and what needs to be done to appease the spirit. For the Lamet, religion does not exist in a distinct sphere of life, but is bound up with the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society.",

Since then the Thai Bhikkhuni community has grown to about 100. There is a community in central Thailand, outside of Bangkok, led by Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, housed in a temple called Wat Songdhammakalyani. Another community, which is part of this network, is led by Bhikkhuni Nanthayani. Her centers are in the north, with Nirotharam located in Chom Tong, and Suttajit in Doi Saket, both within the province of Chiang Mai. The third branch of Nanthayani is international, with bhikkhunis speaking English from all over the world, located in Chiang Rai. The third group is in the South, Koh Yoh in Songkhla province, led by Bhikkhuni Dhammakamala. All of these network members have been ordained in Sri Lanka, and although they live in Thailand, are part of the Sri Lankan Buddhist community, or sangha. This is because full ordination as a Bhikkhuni is illegal both by the state and Buddhist religion in Thailand, since 1928. Because of their ordination experience, and delicate political and religious situation within Thailand, the bhikkhuni communities form a network and strategies to maintain themselves within this unstable and sometimes hostile environment. There are other bhikkhunis living in Thailand, but these are living in smaller groups than the three mentioned above.",

    "description": "âHottentotâ is the name that early European travelers (primarily the 17th century Dutch) gave to the indigenous herders of southern Africa, and âNamaâ refers to a sub-division of the group. âKhoiâ is the preferred name, and means âthe real peopleâ. The first European settlers arrived in the Khoiâs region of southern Africa (the Cape of Good Hope region) in the mid-17th century, and quickly displaced the Khoi to more remote, arid lands. In the 18th century, the Khoi population rapidly declined as a result of warfare, smallpox epidemics, intermarriage with other groups, and integration into settler society. This entry places a focus on the Gei//Khauan tribe around the time of 1860, and relies on ethnographic information that describes the remaining traditional beliefs/practices. The Khoi traditionally lived in tribal communities comprised of several patrilineal clans. One of these clans claimed seniority, and the chieftainship was hereditary within this senior clan. The tribal community was led by the chief and a council of older men. Together, the chief and the council served as the judicial council and controlled matters of communal importance such as feasts, sacrifices, and pasture land relocations. The Khoiâs pastoralist-based subsistence economy required that communities be mobile in order to provide enough food and water to their herds. Information on traditional Khoi religious beliefs and practices for the time this entry focuses on is limited as, âKhoi have been under missionary influence for a considerable length of time, and relatively little information regarding religious beliefs is availableâ (Boonzaier, 2010). Although not described in substantial ethnographic detail, supernatural beings are identified as being present. The most important of these beings include Haitsiaibena, a deified folk-hero, and ghosts of the dead (called /hei/nun, /hei khoin, sobo khoin, or //gaunagu). The /hei/nun do not appear to have been regularly invoked through organized family or tribal ancestor worship. Khoi rituals/ceremonies centered around life-cycle events and the transition from one status to another, emphasizing the times of birth, puberty, adulthood, marriage, and death. During these rituals the concept of !nau is important; !nau is a state of vulnerability/danger that the individual experiences, and is associated with social seclusion and some food taboos. Among the Khoi, a magician/diviner (!gai aob) is a respected and important person within the community. The !gai aob cures people who have been bewitched, and is possibly connected with some religious rites. Although the !gai aob is a respected and important person in the community, he does not appear to be a full-time specialist religious practitioner. For the Khoi, religion is interwoven throughout many aspects of society. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",

The Jivaro live in dispersed, autonomous groups. These groups are not large, village communities, rather, they are comprised of a single extended family (led by a patriarch) that occupies a communal house. No formal, official political office is present. Older men and women who are knowledgeable, experienced, and possess magical power, are called whuÃ©a and ohÃ¡ha, respectively. These individual lead ceremonies at feasts, but are not full-time religious practitioners or powerful leaders. WhuÃ©a are the physicians of the community, using sorcery and divination to cure illness. The Jivaro religion is animistic in nature: almost everything possesses a spirit, and no distinction is made between human souls and the souls inhabiting plants, animals, inanimate objects, and environmental features. There is a concept of reincarnation, with the soul changing from one existence to another, but these beliefs are not linked to a formal system of thought or aspects of morality. The Jivaro have two words for describing spirits: wakÃ¡ni (spirit of the deceased) and iguÃ¡nchi (souls of people who were particularly feared or powerful during life, such as medicine-men and sorcerers). Also present are two deities known as Earth-mother NungÃ¼i and her husband ShakaÃ«ma. These beings are considered the mother and father of the Jivaro, and are associated with crops and cultivation. The Jivaro religion does not exist within a distinct sphere of life. Rather, it is bound up with the function of society as a whole.

    "description": "The Kaska are native to the Canadian regions of northwestern British Columbia, southern Yukon, and southwestern Northwest Territories. This entry focuses primarily on the Upper Liard Kaska (located northwest of Lower Post, British Columbia) around the time of 1900, predominantly using reconstructive ethnographic information collected by principal authority anthropologist John Honigmann during field expeditions in the 1940s. For the Kaska, continuous contact with Europeans began in the 1820s at the Hudson Bay Company post Fort Halkett, on Liard River. During this time, Protestant and Catholic missionaries visited the area, but did not start continuous work until the establishment of the mission at McDame Creek on the Dease River in 1926. Consequently, this entry focuses on Kaska beliefs and practices as they existed prior to major changes as a result of contact with foreigners. Traditional Kaska beliefs recognized a variety of supernatural beings, including spirits, souls of the departed, and monsters. However, these beings are not described in substantial detail, perhaps because, as Honigmann (1954:100) notes, âcosmological speculation remained unelaborated in aboriginal Kaska culture.â Kaska religious practitioners were known as shamans and specialized in curing, divination, and clairvoyance. Anyone could become a shaman and gain powers by successfully completing a vision quest, during which the individual would dream of animals and communicate with their spirits. Ethnographic materials reference religious ceremonies including the vision quest (undertaken by young men around the time of puberty), as well as summer dances and potlatches. The most important socio-political unit among the Kaska is the local band, which is typically comprised of the matrilocal extended family and led by the head of the family. The Upper Liard River Kaska were divided into two exogamous matrilineal moieties: the Wolf and the Crow. For the Kaska, religion is not a distinct sphere of life. It is interwoven throughout the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",

    "description": "The Marquesans are the native inhabitants of what are now the Marquesan Islands of French Polynesia. Six of the traditionally inhabited islands are Fatu Hiva, Tahu Ata, Hiva Oa, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, and Nuku Hiva. This entry focuses on the Te-iâi chiefdom of southwestern Nuku Hiva Island around the time of 1800, and uses the term âMarquesanâ in reference to those living at this specific time and place. This entry relies predominantly on the work of Edward Handy (1923), who completed fieldwork from 1920-1921, and used accounts of early travelers and the memory of older informants to reconstruct the Marquesan culture as it existed in the past. At the time this entry focuses on, the Marquesans had contact with Europeans, however, contact with Christian missionaries did not begin until after this entryâs focal time; Christian missionaries did not start to have influence until about 1840. Consequently, this entry describes traditional Marquesan culture as it existed prior to changes as a result of outside influence. Traditionally, Marquesan society was comprised of many âchiefdomsâ, each led by a chief who gained authority from the social prestige and power of heading a large, wealthy family and holding alliances with other powerful families. Although some ethnographers use the word âtribeâ in reference to these social groups, the Marquesanâs political structure appears to be comprised of simple chiefdoms (see Thomas, 2011). These chiefdoms were not usually in clearly-defined territories, and had shifting alliances and competition, resulting in frequent warfare. In addition to a chief, each group had an inspirational priest (tauâa), who was also involved with political activity, and was just as influential as the civil chief. The tauâa was spoken of as etua (godly), and could enter a possession state to communicate with the tribal god (a deified ancestral priest or chief). The tauâa also had charge of caring for the dead, and presiding at tribal [chiefdom] ceremonials. Slightly lower in rank and importance was the ceremonial priest (tuhuna oâono, tuhuka oâoko), who recited and led chants/rituals during religious ceremonies. The Marquesans had a variety of feasts and festivals, including those associated with harvest and subsistence-related activities, as well as the important events in a chiefâs family (such as marriage, tattooing, and death). Religious performances held during these festivals included chants, dances, tapu, and sacrifices. The most important religious event was the memorial festival, which took place long after the death of a chief/chiefess, inspirational priest, or ceremonial priest, and was held for the deification of the deceasedâs sprit. Marquesan gods (as categorized by Handy, 1923:224) include gods of myth and creation, departmental gods (gods of nature and the elements, occupations, sickness), tutelary deities (personal, family, and tribal ancestral spirits), and a class of demi-gods (legendary heroes and other characters). These categories are not rigid, and a god could belong to multiple categories. All gods of all classes are ultimately ancestral in nature. For the Marquesans, religion did not exist within a separate sphere of life. Religion was bound up with the functioning of society at large; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",

    "description": "The Gikuyu refer to themselves as the âGikuyuâ or âAgikuyuâ; âKikuyuâ is their spoken language, and also the name used by British Colonial administration and anthropologists (Davison, 2010). The Gikuyu live in central Kenya in the administrative districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall (Murangâa), Nyeri, Embu, and Meru (as defined in the 1920âs). This entry focuses specifically on the Gikuyu living in the Fort Hall District of Kenya around the time of 1920. By this time, British colonialists held political control over the Gikuyu, and Christian missionaries had arrived in the area. Despite such contact, the Gikuyu culture and religious beliefs at the specific time and place this entry focuses on remains largely traditional. Gikuyu socio/political organization centers around three factors: the family group (mbari/nyomba), the clan (moherega), and an age-grading (riika) system that unites the whole society. The family, led by a patriarch, is the main social, economic, and religious unit. No full-time religious specialists (such as priests or shamans) are present. Rather, \"in religious ceremonies, and in political and social gatherings, the elders hold supreme authority\" (Kenyatta, 1953:263). Elders serve as intermediaries between Ngai (the high god) and ancestral spirits, and maintained communication with these beings (especially through the form of sacrificial ceremonies). The highest status for a Gikuyu man is the religious or sacrificial council (Kiama Kia Maturanguru), which is reached after passing through and being initiated into all age-grades. The religious and sacrificial council are considered âholy menâ who are charged with leading all religious and ethical ceremonies. For the Gikuyu, religion is interwoven with all aspects of life; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",

    "description": "The Pentecost (Sa) are those native to the area of what is now the southern part of Pentecost Island, Vanuatu, Melanesia. Note that in this entry, the term \"Pentecost\" refers to the southern Pentecost. For the Pentecost, contact with Europeans and the arrival of Missionaries began in the late eighteenth century. Despite the long presence of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Christ, not all Pentecost were converted to Christianity; at the time this entry focuses on, 130 of the 400 Pentecost people were non-Christian. Principal ethnographic authority, Robert B. Lane (1965:250), notes that âthe non-Christian population consciously maintains a relatively unaltered aboriginal culture, albeit with reduced flourish owing to diminished population and to contact with Europeans.â Following Lane, this entry focuses on the remaining aboriginal culture, specifically in the village of Bunlap around the time of 1953. At this time, the Pentecost were horticulturalists, with patrilineages serving as the main social and political unit. High-ranking men (initiated males possessing greater age, experience, and magico-religious power) held both political decision-making power as well as ritual knowledge. Full-time religious practitioners were not present, but those with more magical (gurian) knowledge and power had the semi-professional status of ritualists and sorcerers. Mythology centers on culture heroes and sib (lineage) ancestors, as well as supernatural beings. Supernatural beings are present, but not described in substantial ethnographic details. They include spirit-beings of three types: armat en sanga (incorporeal beings capable of assuming human form), lipsipsip (malicious dwarf-creatures), and ghosts. Concerning ceremonies and rituals, the rites of lo sal are âone of the most important institutions of South Pentecost cultureâ (Lane, 1965:269-270). These rites consist of a man giving sacrifices of pigs, gifts, and/or payments to the members of his motherâs and wifeâs sib. A man presents these gifts throughout his life, and the cycle continues with the birth of a son. Lane (1965:251) makes the important observation that \"the people of South Pentecost recognize no category of culture comparable to that which we label religion, nor do they have any institutions which are primarily religious. The phenomena dealt with here permeate much of the culture.\" Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",

Each village usually consists of several dozen roofs/small houses. The members of Raglai family usually include a father, mother and unmarried children. A head of the village is called a âPo Palei,â usually the one who first developed the land or their descendent. Village chiefs are responsible for making offerings to heaven and earth during severe drought. The most prestigious person in the family are called âOng Kei Paleiâ (village elders).

    "description": "The Aweikoma traditionally inhabited a large area in what is now the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, and lived in small, exogamous patrilineal clans. These highly mobile bands were led by chiefs, whose authority was limited. In 1914 the Aweikoma were pacified by the Brazilian Government and relocated to Duque de Caxias Reservation (near Ibirama). This entry focuses on the Aweikoma living on the reservation around the time of 1932, when the principal ethnographic authority, anthropologist Jules Henry, began a two-year ethnographic study in the area. This entry primarily relies on Henryâs field work, which broadly covers Aweikoma life but provides somewhat limited information on the religious realm of life. Traditional Aweikoma religious beliefs and practices were able to be documented as the Brazilian government resisted attempts to establish missions (Henry, Benedict, and Kraus, 1941: xvi). These beliefs involve a variety of supernatural beings, including the spirits of deceased humans (referred to as ghost-souls or kuplÃªng), and monsters (KuchÃ¡gn YunggÃ­ WangdjÃ³ YÃ³in and VÃ©in). The monsters, ghost-soul, and spirits of the natural world are collectively called nggÃ¯yÃºdn. According to Henry, shamans served as religious practitioners in former times, but no shamans were still living during the time of his visit. For the Aweikoma, religion does not exist within its own distinct sphere of life, but rather, is bound up with the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Aweikoma society as a whole.",

The Trumai population was already diminishing by the time of Quainâs visit; he recorded that the village contained four households and a total population of 43 individuals. The village was led by a chieftain who received varying levels of respect from the community. His primary responsibilities were to give daily speeches and coordinate communal projects. Two sub-chiefs were present, and had the sole function of taking office if the chieftain was away from the village. It was possible for a chief to also be a shaman, but at the time of Quainâs visit the chieftain was only able to employ the shamanistic art of curing, which was a skill most adult males could perform. A shaman is distinguished by having the special powers of locating enemy war parties and the ability to see the afterworld. Supernatural beings (ghosts and various non-human spirits) are present, and are the main characters of many Trumai legends/stories, but do not have direct causal efficacy in the earthly realm. Rain (Kaâwizu) was the only being mentioned to interact with the world, and was said to be the agent of rain and storms. A variety of ceremonies were also present during Quainâs visit, with the most important being the ole (manioc) ceremony, which is associated with crop fertility. Religion and the supernatural realm generally do not appear to be of major concern/importance in the daily lives of the Trumai, and many practices and ceremonies have been lost to memory. Murphy and Quain (1955:101) note that âin the case of the Trumai, disinterest in the religious sphere was closely related to disinterest in other aspects of their culture.â Just 10 years after Quainâs visit the Trumai population shrunk to 25, which is hypothesized to be the result of introduced diseases and low birth rate. Note that this entry considers the Trumai religious group to be coterminous with Trumai society.",

This Algonkian-speaking, historically nomadic people refer to themselves as Aâani, meaning âwhite-Clay Peopleâ, and are also known by the Blackfoot name Atsina. In the late 1880âs the Gros Ventre, along with the Assiniboin, were relocated to Fort Belknap Reservation in northern Montana. This entry focuses around the time of 1835-1885, with tribal territory centering around the Milk River, and the Belknap Reservation representing a small portion of Gros Ventre held land. Principal ethnographic authorities use fieldwork, informant accounts, and primary documents to reconstruct Gros Ventre life prior to 1885, which marked the end of the buffalo era and the beginning of consistent missionary contact. The Gros Ventre were traditionally comprised of about 12 bands, each led by a respective chief who was distinguished in war and recognized as the bandâs leader. Each band also had a Flat Pipe and a Feathered Pipe Keeper, both of whom served as religious leaders while also possessing political influence. The bands would periodically come together as a tribal unit, which was led by a tribal leader. Ceremonial organization cut across band organization, and most religious ceremonies were held at the tribal level. Gros Ventre political and religious life were interwoven, and this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large. Gros Ventre religious beliefs included a Supreme Being, who was considered to be the ultimate ruler and controller of all other supernatural beings, as well as the Earth and its inhabitants. The Supreme Being ranked highest in importance; he was always invoked first and received first offerings. Also present in the superntatural realm were ghosts and ancestral spirit helpers, as well as other non-human supernatural beings like Bhaâa, the storm ruler or the thunderbird.",

The Semang do not possess a formal leadership office, either religious or secular. However, a religious specialist is present, and is called halaâ. The halaâ has the special abilities of communicating with the supernatural realm, and serves as medicine-man. An individual becomes halaâ either through a dream, hereditary transmission, or taking possession of the Äebu stone (which has ritual importance). The term Orang hidop refers to supernatural beings, and is best translated as âthe immortalsâ. The orang hidop include spirits of the dead--who linger for several days but ultimately travel to the realm of the dead--as well as other, non-human beings. Of primary importance is the supreme high god Karei, god of thunder, followed by Ta Penân. Also present are Kareiâs wife Manoij, their sons and daughter, Kareiâs servants, and the Äenoi (celestial spirit-beings closely related to the halaâ). The Semangâs most important religious ritual is the blood sacrifice ceremony, during which individuals must draw and sacrifice their own blood in order to appease Karei either after breaking a taboo, or during thunderstorms to prevent further catastrophes. For the Semang, religious aspects of life are not differentiated from the secular. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",

There is no central political authority among the Igbo; the largest social unit is the village-group, bound together by ties but each village is functionally independent. In fact, there is âno individual of outstanding power or authority either directly in things spiritual or indirectly in things secular (Green, 1964:49).â Although there are not official religious leaders among the Igbo, there are two types of religious practitioners: priests and dibeas. Hereditary priests observe taboos and lead ceremonies, but are otherwise viewed as âordinaryâ members of the community (Green, 1964:53). A dibea, on the other hand, undergoes training and initiation rites to become a specialist in the professions of diviner and/or doctor-magician. Various types of supernatural beings are present. There is belief in a supreme high god who is largely viewed as an otiose creator deity overseeing the world from above, and is not typically worshipped directly. Additionally present are the spirits of deceased humans, and ancestor worship appears to be the concern/responsibility of individual households and families. Several non-human spirits are also present, including village and village-group deities. Larger-scale rituals/ceremonies/celebrations are present, such as the annual rites surrounding the worship of the village-group deity. It is important to note the presence of Christian influence among the Igbo, beginning with the arrival of missionaries in the mid 1800âs.

    "description": "The Ojibwa are comprised of ânumerous communities ranging mainly from southern and northwestern Ontario, northern Michigan and central Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Brown and Beierle, 2000).â The term âOjibwaâ describes a larger ethnic and linguistic group that is not politically unified. Historically, Ojibwa contact with Europeans began in the 1640âs with the arrival of fur traders and French Jesuit missionaries. The 1800âs brought an end to treaties and marked the Ojibwa relocations to reservations, occurring after the War of 1812 in the United States, and after the establishment of the Dominion Government in 1867 in Canada (Hallowell, 1955:117).  This entry focuses specifically on the Northern Saulteaux (around the time of 1930), an Ojibwa people who migrated to the more remote area east of Lake Winnipeg. In part, this migration helped the Northern Saulteaux to âconserve a great deal of their aboriginal culture during a period when armed conflicts with an expanding white population, the effects of the fur trade, and Christianization led to more rapid culture changes among the Ojibwa elsewhere (Hallowell, 1955:112).â  This entry primarily utilizes ethnographic information obtained by Alfred Irving Hallowell (the principal ethnographic authority), who completed field work among the Northern Saulteaux from 1930-1940. At this time, the Saulteaux had had contact with Christian missionaries, but native religious beliefs were still held. These native beliefs include several supernatural entities such as ancestral spirits and other non-human beings. Ethnographers have referred to Saulteaux religious practitioners as shamans, medicine men, or conjurers. These individuals had supernatural abilities (often acquired in a religious fast/dream state) including the ability to access knowledge from and communicate with people far away, foretell the future, communicate with supernatural beings and the dead, and solve mysteries. Additionally, these shamans had the power to abduct souls, causing sickness, mental distress, and death. Due to these supernatural abilities, as well as their knowledge and skill, shamans held effective leadership roles (despite the absence of an official political office and official religious leaders). Because religion does not exist in a distinct sphere, but rather pervades all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",

    "description": "The Huichol are native inhabitants of what are now the Mexican States of Jalisco, Nayarit, Zacatecas, and Durango. In 1722 the Huichol were conquered by the Spanish, after which Franciscan Missionaries arrived and nominally converted the Huichol to Christianity before leaving the area in the mid 1800âs (Lumholtz, 1973:22). Missionaries left a varying degree of Christian influence across Huichol communities, but at the time this entry focuses on (around 1890) native beliefs were still held and traditional customs and ceremonies were still practiced; the Huichol religion would become more syncretic with Christianity in the 20th century. To the Huichol, religion does not constitute a separate sphere of life; there is no distinction between sacred and everyday life. As such, this entry considers the Huichol religious group to be coterminous with the society itself. Religious practitioners known as shamans are trained in healing, divining, and priestly activities, and communicate with the supernatural. In addition to the spirits of the dead, the Huichol pantheon contains a variety of deities representing personified natural phenomenon such as fire, air, earth, and water. Fire (also known as Grandfather) is said to be the greatest and oldest, existing before the sun (Father). Fire is associated with deer and peyote. The Huichol âpetition the deities for sun and rain for the crops, successful deer hunts, fertility, good health, and protection from the dangers of the natural and supernatural worldsâ (Schaefer, 2016). The Huichol have an annual cycle of feasts and ceremonies associated with the propitiation of gods, and connected to the agricultural cycle and environmental phenomenon such as rain. Most importantly is the annual journey to sacred (known to the Huichol as hÃ­kulÍi), peyote land, where the plant is harvested and later utilized in rituals and to communicate with the gods.",

The Kwoma are comprised of four autonomous sub-tribes: the Tangwishamp, the Urumbanj, the Koriasi, and the Hongwam; this entry focuses specifically on the Hongwam around the time of 1937. At this time, the Hongwam (hereafter referred to as Kwoma) had some contact with outsiders, including the Ambunti Police Post (and therefore the Australian government) which was located on the southeastern slope of Ambunti mountain. However, substantial culture change (including missionary influence) did not take place until after the time this entry focuses on. The Kwoma do not have an official political office; leadership positions are earned through age, knowledge, and ability. Also absent are official religious leaders; religious activities are performed by what ethnographers have named the Yam cult (because of the yamâs important connection with rituals and social groups). Membership in the highest section and possession of associated ritual knowledge is reserved exclusively for men who have gained importance in the community by having taken a head during a headhunting raid. Although the Kwoma do not have official political officials or religious leaders, the religious sphere of life is not differentiated from other aspects of life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.

    "description": "The Hidatsa are native to the North American Plains, and traditionally lived in semipermanent villages along the upper Missouri River and its tributaries in what is now northwestern North Dakota. Since 1868, the Hidatsa (along with the Mandan and Arikara) have lived on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. This entry focuses on Hidatsa society as it existed prior to the last major smallpox outbreak of 1837, which decimated the Hidatsa population and marked the beginning of more intensive and frequent contact with Europeans and Americans, and subsequent cultural change. This entry relies mainly on information collected by principal ethnographic authority Alfred W. Bowers, who completed fieldwork at Fort Berthold Reservation from 1932-1933. Bowers used the memories of older informants, archaeological data, and early records to reconstruct the period of time prior to 1837. Historically, the Hidatsa lived in three independent villages along the Knife River: Hidatsa-proper, Awatixa, and Awakawi. Each village was led by a council composed of chiefs and ceremonial and war leaders; top leadership positions were held by the owners of certain sacred ceremonial bundles specific to each village. The three villages had a tribal council (of about 10 members) charged with defense against common enemies and the general welfare of the villages. The Hidatsa did not have a clear distinction between secular and religious roles: ceremonial leaders held status equal with or greater than that of chiefs. Social organization centered around elaborate clan and age-grade systems. A clan was a named matrilineal group associated with its own traditions and mythology and was responsible for taking care of its members. Clans cut across villages, and were important aspects of social, economic, and ceremonial life. Additionally, ââ¦the entire male and female population was arranged in a series of groupings based on age. For the greater part of the population, these groups were formally organized with names, symbols of membership, songs, and prescribed rites and rules of behaviorâ (Bowers, 1954:174). Both men and women had religious societies within the age-grade system, and men also had military societies. An individualâs clan and age-grade determined his or her position/role in the village, as well as social and ceremonial duties. The Hidatsa have an extensive and elaborate ceremonial system associated with various supernatural beings, natural phenomena, and agricultural and subsistence cycles. It is important to note that âat the base of all Hidatsa religious activities and concepts is the belief in individual and group-owned supernatural powers which are controlled according to long-standing rulesâ (Bowers, 1965:282). These supernatural powers are acquired from supernatural beings during vision experiences, and are associated with either tribal or personal sacred bundles. The owner of a sacred/ritual bundle also possesses the associated myth and ceremonial procedures. The owner thus leads the associated ceremony and is responsible for knowing where it lies in the ceremonial cycle (e.g. which ceremonies precede and follow). The ceremonial system is open to the occasional introduction of new bundle rites (the result of purchase or vision experiences).  Because Hidatsa religious beliefs and practices are interwoven throughout society as a whole, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Hidatsa society itself.",

    "description": "This entry focuses on the Eyak living in the Copper River Delta, Alaska, around the time of 1890. The principal ethnographic source of information (Birket-Smith and De Laguna, 1938) reconstructs this focal time using informant testimony, written sources, and the account of American Colonel Abercrombieâs visit to the area in 1884. Reconstruction was necessary given that by the beginning of the 20th century, ââ¦the 'civilizing' of the Eyak was practically complete, and they had almost ceased to exist as a separate tribal entityâ (Birket-Smith and De Laguna, 1938:360-361). Consequently, limited information on the Eyakâs non-material culture was available, making a description of Eyak religious beliefs and practices somewhat limited. However, enough information is available to gather a general picture these religious beliefs and practices. Overall, the Eyak beliefs are animistic in nature, as âall animate and inanimate things have souls or spirit âownersââ (Birket-Smith and De Laguna, 1938:230). The spirits of deceased human beings are present, but not described in detail. There is indication that the sun was important and worshipped in earlier times. Also present are a variety of supernatural beings (often associated with natural elements or meteorological phenomenon), such as the somewhat mythic Thunderbird, or the spirit in control of the Copper River. Magic plays an important role in daily life, including taboos and superstitions around subsistence activities. Fasting served as a means of invoking the supernatural, or (in addition to sexual abstinence) promoting ritual purity. Witches and shaman are both present, and could be either male or female. Witches are differentiated as they only use their powers for evil. Shamans, on the other hand, possess high esteem; they serve as ritual leaders, medical/supernatural healers, and can enter trance states to foresee future events. Informants believe their powers are possibly inherited somehow, and note that their spirit helper(s) manifest(s) in dreams. Shamans are not equivalent to chiefs, but chiefs can command the services of shaman. Because religion does not exist in a distinct realm, but is rather bound up with the functioning of society at large, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",

They have, however, been driven back into the western part of the country, the remainder of which is now inhabited by various invadersâ¦â (Felkin, 1885:205). This entry focuses on the Fur living in the Jebel Marra area of Darfur around the time of 1880. Although Darfur was taken by the Egyptians in the 1870âs, the province of Jebel Marra was not actually subjugated until 1881 when the last sultan (Haroun) was killed. Darfur later became a province of Sudan in the 1910âs. At the time this entry focuses on, Darfur was divided into five provinces (each ruled by an official), with each province subdivided into smaller districts led by local governors. A hereditary sultan oversaw Darfur as a whole. After centuries of cultural contact with Arab peoples and Islamic beliefs, the Fur are primarily Muslim, but elements of their original beliefs remain (such as agricultural festivals, and they have laws differing from those of the Koran). The Fur religious beliefs center on Molu, the one high god. Also present are spirits of the deceased, but these supernatural beings are not involved in daily life. Religious practitioners known as puggeeâs had influence over the Sultan and chiefs, and were often more powerful than chiefs. Any male could become a puggee after training in reading, writing, and the Koran, as well as Fur law. Religion does not have its own distinctive sphere in Fur life; rather, it is bound up with the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society.",

The most important social unit of the Badjau is the nuclear family, which will occasionally come together at moorages to form family alliance units that cooperate for work activities and religious ceremonies. In addition to family alliances, the Badjau recognize about seven localized kin groups (comprised of related family alliance units that regularly moor together). Localized kin groups are led by a headman, and usually contain at least one djin. Social organization among the Badjau is fluid and constantly changing as families move from moorage to moorage.",

    "description": "This entry is based upon ethnographic materials that reconstruct the Huron society prior to cultural changes as a result of outside influence. Reconstruction is made possible from accounts written by European traders and Jesuit missionaries during early contacts with the Huron. This entry focuses on the Bear (Attignawantan) and Cord (Attigneenongnahac) subtribes around the time of 1634, which were located between Lake Simcoe and the Georgian Bay in what is now Ontario, Canada. These two subtribes are the largest and oldest of the four Huron subtribes (the other two being the Tahontaenrat and Arendahronon). At the focal time of 1634, the village was the primary unit of daily life, encompassing social, economic, and religious importance. The village was led by a council of elders, a war chief, and a general chief. However, this varied by village and sometimes several chiefs were present. Leaders acted as a council, with no chief outranking others, and holding their position on the basis of ability, experience, success, courage, etc. Religion did not have its own distinct sphere in Huron society, rather, it was a part of all Huron beliefs and practices; âto them, their religion and way of life were one and the sameâ (Trigger, 1976:75). Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society. The Huron did not have religious specialists (e.g. a shaman or priest position), rather, chiefs often held ritual offices and duties in addition to their secular roles. The religion did not have a well-defined pantheon of supernatural beings, but the most important deity is the sky, serving as a present but otiose high god. Also present are previously human spirits, but these beings are not discussed in extensive ethnographic details. Non-human supernatural beings include Iouskeha and Aataentsic (two of the most important, best-personified, and most described beings), as well as  ââ¦ animate spirits [that] resided in the earth, the rivers, lakes, certain rocks, and the sky and had control over journeying, trading, war feasts, disease, and other matters\" (Tooker, 1964:80). Religious observances (e.g. taboos, superstitions) were associated with almost all aspects of Huron life, such as subsistence strategies and life cycle events. Four types of feasts were held, including singing (celebratory) feasts, thanksgiving feasts, curing feasts, and farewell feasts.",

This area is located primarily in the Indian state of Mizoram, but also extends into Burma and Bangladesh. The Lakher are comprised of six groups: the Tlongsai, Hawthai, Zeuhnang, Sabeu, Lialai, and Heima. These groups are further subdivided into clans, but the village (led by a chief or bei) is the primary social, political, and religious unit. This entry focuses around the time of 1930; just six years after the Lakhers came under British rule. At this time, Lakher customs remained largely unchanged by foreign influence (British government and Christian Missionaries), and traditional religious beliefs were still held by the majority of the Lakher population. The Lakherâs supreme high god is known as Khazangpa, who is believed to have created the world and holds control over all its inhabitants. Other supernatural beings include zang (tutelary deities/guardian spirits), leurahripas (demons/evil spirits), and ancestral spirits. No official religious practitioners are present; the heads of households perform most rites and sacrifices. Mediums (zhazanghneipa) have special communication with spirits, and typically use this communication for medicinal purposes (such as finding out what sacrifices to prescribe a woman hoping to increase her fertility, for example). Ceremonies are present, and accompany most major life-cycle events. Also present is a yearly cycle of rites/feasts associated primarily with agriculture and the propitiation of supernatural beings.  Zhazangpina is the most important sacrificial rite, which is performed by the head of a household in hopes of pleasing Zhazangpa, who will in turn bless the household with good health and prosperity. The Lakherâs religious beliefs are bound up with the functioning of society as a whole, so this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",

Mata devotees have typically belonged to lower-caste and Dalit groups, though middle-caste groups such as Rajputs also hold Matas in high esteem as clan goddesses. Mata worship has traditionally taken place at small shrines in rural areas and villages, though Mata temples have recently grown in size and number in urban areas, particularly since the liberalization of India's economy in 1990. The number of Mata adherents is difficult to calculate, as individual religious affiliation is often plural in Gujarati Hinduism, though the figure is likely growing, as a gaining preference for a Brahmin-styled ritual repertoire at Mata sites has drawn in some upper-caste devotees.",

Christian missionaries arrived in the region around the mid-1800's, but found little success in conversion attempts. The Santal religion is primarily concerned with numerous spirits/deities known as Bongas, which are of various classes (such as clan, village, family, and specific places). A high god is present but otiose. The village priest (Ato Naeke) and his assistant (Kudam Naeke) are responsible for communicating with the supernatural realm, as well leading communal religious ceremonies. In addition to the Ato Naeke and Nudam Naeke are other practitioners, such as the hunt-priest (Dehri), herbalist/medicine man, Bonga-doctor (Ojha), and witch detector (Jan guru) (Biswas, 1956:107). Religious practitioners (mainly the village priest) typically work with the village headmen.

Since 1820, the Aymara have been under rule by the Bolivian and Peruvian Republics. Historically, the Aymara have faced pressure by dominant groups, beginning with their conquest by the Inca around 1430, and later the Spanish Conquest in the 1530âs. With the Spaniards came missionaries and the Aymara soon had contact with First Dominicans, Jesuits, Catholics, and Protestants. Spanish Catholicism was particularly influential, and has been incorporated into the Aymaraâs traditional beliefs.  Consequently, the Aymara have a variety of supernatural beings, including Christian deities (God/Christ, the Virgin, and Saints), as well as aboriginal deities (guardians, place spirits, physiographical and meteorological spirits, and demons).  Further, there are several types of religious specialists (see Tschopik, 1951:219d).

These beliefs included a variety of supernatural beings (mara), as well as kin group origin stories with kupuna (supernatural) ancestors and sacred places and animals.

The central religious activity was the Oracle at Delphi, also known as the \"Pythia\" after the primordial, mythical python slain by the god Apollo at the site to claim it for the Greek pantheon. The Pythia was both the high priestess of Apollo and his oracular mouthpiece, uttering authoritative but vague and often frenzied prophecies that made her the object of fascination across the ancient Mediterranean. The Pythia was attended by a formal priesthood in charge of the cult site and its practices. This cult site grew to become a major cultural and pilgrimage center, with extensive structures including temples, a treasury, theater, sanctuary, gymnasium, stadium, hippodrome, and extensive statuary and other offerings.",

The Mapuche were incorporated into the Chilean government through a reservation system established in the 1880's (Faron, 1960). Despite this reservation system and contact with missionaries, the Mapuche religion remained un-Christianized (Faron, 1964:199). The religious beliefs involve a variety of supernatural beings, including a supreme god, regional deities, deified ancestral spirits, and the spirits of the recently deceased, which are the Mapuche's closest connection to the realm of the supernatural. Religious practitioners are either shamans (machis), who are generally benevolent, lead rituals, and practice medicine, or witches (kalkus), who are generally evil and are involved with malevolent spirits and practices. The most important religious ceremonies among the Mapuche are Ãillatun and Awn. Ãillatun is an agricultural rite for general protection and prosperity, and Awn are funeral rites, which are important for getting souls of the recently deceased to the afterlife. Because religious beliefs are integrated with Mapuche society, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.

This entry focuses on Graham and Moresby Islands, specifically the town of Masset, around the time of 1875-before extensive contact with Europeans and christianization. Traditionally, the main social and political unit of the Haida was the moiety (the Raven and Eagle), comprised of several lineages. Lineages were not ranked, although some were more powerful than others, and each lineage was led by a matrilineal chief. There was no overarching political unit above the lineage. The traditional religious beliefs of the Haida included a variety of supernatural beings, a belief in reincarnation, and the presence of shamans. Because religion overlaps with many elements of life among the Haida, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",

They have lived in the Havasupai Reservation since its establishment in 1880. This entry focuses on the Havasupai living in this reservation around the time of 1918. At this time, the Havasupai's primary social and political unit was the family, with no other divisions (such as clans, moieties, or even lineages beyond three generations) acknowledged (Beierle, 2011). Leadership was based upon prestige, and chieftainship is most accurately viewed as the embodiment of this prestige rather than an official leadership role with clearly defined functions (Spier, 1928:235). The Havasupai belief system centered on ideas about the soul and afterlife, spirits and gods, as well as shamanism. \"Religion and ceremonialism were not highly developed among the Havasupai and formed only a minor part in tribal life (Beierle, 2011). As a result, the Havasupai religion is only described in limited ethnographic details.",

    "description": "The Meo, also called Mev or Mewati Muslim, self-identify as a distinct socio-cultural ethnic community, and, despite their Muslim religion, trace their lineage to the Hindu Rajputs in North India. It is also contended that the Meo converted to Islam after leaving other Hindu caste groups and a tribe, Meena, with whom they shared several similarities or that they were a nomadic Islamic tribe called the Mids, or Meds, who migrated from Western India into the region now known as Mewat, between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Today, perceived as converts from Hinduism, the Meo, numbering around 20 lakh, are considered low caste, or Neech zat, by the Indian Muslims. The Meo men and women are disfavoured for marriage by the Indian Muslims because of their suspect religious identity and their low caste status within the Muslim hierarchy.\n\nTill recently, they have considered themselves both as a caste group and a distinct religious faith within Islam because of this dual identity. During the colonial period, they were considered a distinct caste by both Hindus and Muslims. Their customs, traditions, life cycle ceremonies and modes of prayer, till the 1990s, closely replicated the Hindus with nominal adherence to Islamic practices like circumcision, nikah or marriage ceremony, and the burial. Though lauded for their syncretic culture and religious practises that adopted and adapted traditions from both religions without succumbing to the hard-core religiosity of either, they historically faced rejection from both the faiths because of their identification as neither a âtrueâ Muslim nor Hindu. \n\nHistorically, the Meo inhabited a geographically contiguous space called Mewat or the âland of the Meoâ, understood more as a cultural space than an administrative unit. In present-day India, it is administratively divided up between the districts of Nuh (formerly Mewat), Palwal, and Faridabad in southern Haryana and Alwar and Bharatpur and Dholpur districts in Rajasthan. A small portion of historical Mewat also lies in western Uttar Pradesh; however, it is in Nuh, Haryana that they comprise an overwhelming majority.",

    "description": "The Tikopia inhabit the island of Tikopia, which is a part of the Solomon Islands in Melanesia. Although geographically the Tikopia are Melanesian, they are linguistically and culturally Polynesian (Firth and Beierle, 1995). The Tikopia are organized into four essentially autonomous clans, with each clan containing several lineages. The island is divided into two districts: Faea and Ravenga. Tikopian contact with Christianity began in 1858 with the arrival of the Melanesian Mission, which was part of the Church of England abroad. The mission did not have a major influence until 1923, when Ariki Tafua (chief) converted and the whole district of Faea followed, effectively converting half the island (Firth, 1970:308). This entry focuses on the district of Ravenga circa 1930, which at the time predominantly followed traditional pagan beliefs and practices. This polytheistic religion centered on the spirits of deceased humans (including those of ancestors, the recently deceased, and deceased chiefs), as well as non-human gods and non-personalized spirits. An elaborate ritual calendar dictated when ceremonies were to be held. The clan chief acted simultaneously as the priest, and was assisted by ritual elders. The Tikopia religious group is coterminous with the society at large.",

The Copper Inuit, at the time this entry focuses on, were nomadic and inhabited the coastal regions of the Coronation Gulf, ranging from Victoria Island in the north and the opposite shores in the south, to the Kent Peninsula in the east and Stapylton Bay in the west. The Copper Inuit did not have official political leadership; power was fluid among these nomadic people. Their religious beliefs centered around non-human and human spirits, as well as strongly held taboos related to the separation of land and sea. Shamans were mediators between the living and supernatural, and their powers were due to control over spirits. Shamans had limited secular influence.

This text is one of the earliestâif not the earliestâexamples of Pashto used as a language of writing. Some members of the Roshaniyya were initiated as disciples of Bayazid, but the term may also include those \"tribal\" communities in the Afghan highlands that temporarily allied with Bayazid Ansari in an armed resistance against the Mughal Empire. After a protracted struggle with Mughal forces, the Roshaniyya were defeated and their intellectual lineages aborted.",

He was one of the first emissaries of Hinduism in America. In 1965, the Immigration and Naturalization Act allowed for increased immigration from all regions of India to the US. These immigrants were mostly skilled workers, particularly in areas related to technology and medicine. This ushered in an era of temple building. Also at this time, there were many  Indian gurus who began movements in the United States, gathering followers and espousing wisdom. These gurus brought yoga with them and what was originally a Hindu meditative practice often became separated from its origins in its American context. Finally, these immigrants started families and now there are many Hindu-Americans who were born and raised in the United States. Temples continued to grow as community centers in part to educate this new generation of Hindus. This is different from how Hindu temples function in India. \n\nHindus in America are people of both Indian and non-Indian origin who practice Hinduism in its American diasporic context, where there is no overarching governing structure, but where \"Hinduism\" as a whole becomes more codified, regardless of regional or sectarian differences, in part due to its contrast with other religious groups. Hinduism in this context is often referred to as ecumenical.",

Vodun consists of African traditions with Catholic influence; key features include the communication with gods through rituals containing dance and spirit possession, which are often led by religious specialists.

The first missionaries arrived in New Zealand in 1814, but a change in indigenous religious beliefs was gradual and not salient until several decades later. The Maori did not have a distinct religious sphere; religious beliefs and practices were interwoven with secular life and thus the religious group is coterminous with society itself. The key forces in Maori religion are tapu (the prohibitions or laws emanating from the gods), makutu (magic), and mana (spiritual and intellectual power).

Indian and Chinese influence and trade have been present since the eighth century, and have brought Islamic and Buddhist religious beliefs. The Dutch gained control over Java in the eighteenth century, which lasted until Indonesia gained sovereignty in 1949 (Martin, 2010). With such a variety of contact, the Javanese religious beliefs are, unsurprisingly, predominantly syncretic. Three main religious traditions are present: the santri (purer Islamic subtradition), the prijaji (mainly stresses Hindu beliefs), and the abangan (integration of animism, Hundu, Buddhist, and Islamic beliefs) (Geertz, 1960:5). This entry focuses on the syncretic beliefs of the abangan Javanese. It is important to stress the variation and complexity of spiritual life in Java, as Java is \"not easily characterized under a single label or easily pictured in terms of a dominant theme. It is particularly true that in describing the religion of such a complex civilization as the Javanese any simple unitary view is certain to be inadequate...\" (Geertz, 1960:7).",

    "description": "The Veerashaivas are devotees of Shiva, who emerged in in the 12th century, in regions that are now the modern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Veerashaiva path of devotion or bhakti was one that sought to remind its society that the mechanical performance of ritual would not help achieve 'arivu' or understanding. Arivu, led to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death. They also reminded the people around them that for moksha and for sadhana (striving towards it), all were equal, irrespective of class, caste and gender. Quite spontaneously, a number of people from different castes and communities followed this path of devotion and charted their self-transformation through a spontaneous verbalization of experience known as vachanas or simply, speech. Some describe the self-transormation in terms of six phases or Shatsthalas, which are Bhaktasthala, (2) Maheshsthala, (3) Prasadisthala, (4) Pranalingi Sthala, (5)\nSharanasthala and (6) Aiykasthala. \n\nTogether, the Veerashaiva saints of the 12th century founded the Anubhava Mantapa, a forum for the discussion of experience, in the city of Kalyana, northern Karnataka. Anubhava literally means experience. Prominent figures of this mode of bhakti are Allama Prabhu, Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Soole Sankavva, Ayadakki Maramma, Devara Dasimayya and others. \n\nThe vachanas explicate a yogic path and are essentially oral literature. The Veerashaivas are said to have emerged from earlier Shaivite sects such as the Kaalamukha and their tradition derives much from the Agamas. Many devotees of the Veerashaiva tradition took to expressing their devotion through madhura bhava (known specifically within the tradition as satipati bhava) or, love for the chosen deity and through surrender or sharanagati. The philosophy of surrender led to the Veerashaiva devotees to become known as 'shivasharanas.' For the Veerashaivas, Shiva is composed of Guru (teacher), Linga (abstract form of Shiva) and Jangama (guru with no attachments). The Veerashaivas believe in qualified monism or qualified non-dualism. \n\nAlthough the Veerashaivas expressed devotion in filial terms, their approach was largely renunciatory. They, however, did not quit society like other renunciants but instead stayed within and continued their duties. This continuation of the performance of labour but dedicating it from the beginning till end to the deity, Shiva, they considered as kayaka.",

    "description": "The Warrau inhabit the Orinoco Delta of northeastern Venezuela and traditionally lived in villages known as Rancherias, which were comprised of about five to twenty families. This entry focuses on the time of about 1930. At this point, missionaries had established contact with the Warrau, but the indigenous belief system had not been Christianized. The religious and cultural traditions of the Warrau varied regionally as a result of extreme geographic isolation, but shared a common belief in the god Jebu, the presence of their sanctuary (house of the Jebu), priests (guisidatu), prayers and offerings to Jebu, as well as religious celebrations and dances (Turrado and Muirden, 1945:302). The belief system of the Warrau is not an official or organized religion, but an aspect of life interwoven with society. Further, the Warrau did not place a strong emphasis on a belief in the afterlife, and did not possess rites, ceremonies, religious scripture or credo (Turrado and Muirden, 1945:302). As such, the Warrau religion is most accurately considered to be coterminous with society itself. Presently, the Warrau fall under the jurisdiction of the Venezuelan administration (Dieter and Beierle, 2001).",

The Nyakyusa are linguistically and culturally similar to the Ngonde, who live on the northwestern coastal plain of Lake Malawi. After the establishment of European colonial regimes (ca. 1870s), the Ngonde became a part of the British Protectorate of Nyasaland (known as Malawi after independence), and the Nyakyusa were incorporated into the German colony of Tanganyika (Now Tanzania). After World War I, Tanganyika passed to the British, who assumed the territory under a League of Nations mandate and administered it until independence. (Kenny, 2011).  \n\nThe Nyakyusa religion is best characterized as a system of shared beliefs and ritual practices that are interwoven with Nyakyusa society at large. The major elements of their religion include ancestral spirits, mystical powers, and the presence of witchcraft. A sizeable Christian minority coexists in Nyakyusa society as a result of missionary influence; this entry focuses on the native beliefs shared among the majority of the population ca. 1930, before the more extensive incorporation of Christian ideas.",

Those living in settlement villages are more likely to attend regular services of religions like Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam, and they are more likely to enroll their children in school. Nevertheless, \"forest people\" and \"settlement people\" are not distinct groups: not only do families commonly keep residences both in the rainforest and in the settlement villages, but people who live in the forest typically have family members who live permanently in settlement villages.

    "description": "As Ching Hai initiates do not prefer to speak of their community as religious, it may be more precise to describe Suma Ching Hai as a transnational cybersect primarily composed of diasporic East and Southeast Asians. Suma Ching Hai is inseparable from a vast mediascape of online lectures, videos, chat groups, commercial enterprises and tightly-controlled official messaging. Sum Ching Hai is also a New Religious Movement that blends together aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and messianic theology. The charisma of the Supreme Leader Ching Hai, called Thanh Háº£i in Vietnamese, binds the community together. She is often revered by initiates as partly divine, as a perfected being who preaches the proper meditation style (Quan Yin Method) and spreads compassion and the uplift of spiritual consciousness. Born in Vietnam, raised in the West and now based in Taiwan, Ching Hai teaches a syncretistic theology. Based on her time in India, she incorporates Sant Mat traditions, Surat Shabd Yoga (emphasizing divine sound and light), and Radhasoami as practiced in Beas. There are many similar theological touch points: 2 1/2 hours of required daily meditation; spiritual progression through stages of consciousness; abilities to experience astral planes; and total devotion on the spiritual master as an aspect of divinity. Practitioners of Ching Hai are given initiation after watching and summarizing (in written essays) 90 lectures of Ching Hai (available online) and practicing vegetarianism for at least 3 months. They are initiated by either Ching Hai herself or, more likely, by about twenty disciples who are authorized to perform initiations. Children of initiates are given \"half initiation\" at 6 and \"full initiation\" at 12 based on their spiritual advancement. Practice of Ching Hai depends on region: in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam especially) and China, governments have branded Ching Hai as an \"evil cult\" and news stories abound about confiscations of illegal religious material or cult-like forms of psychological manipulation of initiates. In Vietnam, for example, Thanh Háº£i followers in Hanoi do so surreptitiously, with fear of government reprisal. Their meditation center is secret. Conversely, Thanh Háº£i  followers in Ho Chi Minh City are building an official meditation center and do not live under the same shroud of fearful secrecy. Besides official adherents, there are many people who practice Quan Yin Method privately and consume online material related to Ching Hai without identifying explicitly with a community or even community of faith. The global community of Ching Hai followers could be briefly summarized as bounded together by a range of theological beliefs, meditation practices and forms of digital consumption. Significant communities exist in Taiwan (called Qinghai Wushang Shijie Hui), where the main headquarters were established in 1986. Of Vietnamese origin, several thousand are practitioners and refer to Ching Hai affectionately as Chi Hai (\"eldest sister\" in Vietnamese). Other concentrated populations of practitioners are in mainland China (although banned officially), South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and California. Based on five normative precepts -- which includes not taking life and eating a vegan diet -- non-initiates of a vegan persuasion may discover this NRM by visiting one of 160 or so Loving Hut restaurants -- from Prague to Hanoi to San Jose -- where they will be exposed to Ching Hai's spiritually-infused artwork on the walls and her teachings beaming through 24 hour satellite TV. A cursory glance through online and printed media highlights the importance of veganism and these restaurants in shaping the public perception of Ching Hai (which is sometimes branded a \"Vegan Cult\" in Vice, for example).",

    "description": "The tribal Christian population of the high Himalayas and low-lying hills spans five countries (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China) and contested boarderlands (Tibet, Sikkim, Aksai Chin and Kashmir, among others). It encompasses approximately 6 million people. The largest Christian tribal populations are 4.9 million converted Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics in Northeast India and 375,000 Evangelical Protestants in Nepal (a figure sometimes rounded up to 1 million) -- arguably the fastest-growing Christian population in the world. Small but important Christian tribal communities are in Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. The historical timeline of tribal conversion to Christianity depends on the region and date of missionary penetration into the hills. The Portuguese Jesuit JoÃ£o Cabral was arguably the first European to access the Himalayan region in 1627 with missionary designs. Since then, thousands of missionaries have come into the Himalayan region, from the London-based Church Missionary Society (Punjab region through the 20th century) to the recent explosion of South Korean missionaries populating language institutes and centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Indigenous house churches have sprouted up in remote tribal villages. Himalayan tribal Christianity falls into a broad spectrum of official affiliation. Some expressions of tribal Christianity are largely indigenous and invisible; they address local aspirations and offer respite from spiritual affliction and caste discrimination within circumscribed tribal cosmologies and social stratifications. Other expressions of tribal Christianity are hooked into international NGOs and global ideoscapes promoting salvation that are backed by foreign patronage and theological instruction; they are networked through social media platforms and employ a range of conversion techniques associated with Western (and South Korean) Evangelicalism. In some cases, tribal Christianity in the Himalayas allows discriminated-against Dalit groups who are embedded within tribal formations to find self-respect and social validation within the new idiom of salvation and equality under Yesu Masih (Jesus Christ). Although Christians are persecuted throughout South Asia, overt violence against the minority religion is not as strongly evident in the Himalayan tribal range as it is in Pakistan and non-Himalayan India states (especially Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where in 2007-08 in Kandhamal District 50 Christians were killed and 95 churches burned down). The rise of right-wing Hindutva politics since 2014 and the disproportionate criminalization of Christian conversion as coercive have pushed Christianity further into the social margins everywhere through India, including the Himalayan tribal belt. As would be expected, Christian tribals in the Himalayas are not strongly unified around their minority religious status; divided by language, geography and often theology and sectarian affiliation, they are sometimes balkanized into subdividing communities. Nevertheless, they are conceptually and anthropologically interconnected as a Pan-Himalayan community of faith, spiritual aspiration and unique forms of theological syncretism.",

Gaddis are commonly called a tribe, although they have a complex history in being awarded Scheduled Tribe status in Kangra and ethnopolitical mobilizations are underway to include Dalits within the Gaddi tribal fold. The community is heterogeneous, spread across a large swath of the Western Himalayas extending into Kashmir. Primarily Shaivite, some low-status Gaddis have converted into a range of new spiritual beliefs.

    "description": "ÅrÄ«vaisÌ£á¹avism is a Hindu sect that worships VisÌ£á¹u along with his consort ÅrÄ«, the main leader of which is RÄmÄnuja (traditional dates: 1017: 1137), a proponent of visÌisÌ£taÌdvaita (âqualified non-dualismâ). This tradition is based on ubhaya-vedÄnta, i.e. both the Sanskrit and the Tamil scriptures. The latter consists essentially of the poetry of the Äá¸»vÄrs (Tamil bhakti poets [6th-9th centuries]), collectively known as the NÄlÄyira Tivviya Pirapantam (or NÄlÄyira Divya Prabandham), especially NammÄá¸»vÄrâs TiruvÄymoá¸»i, which is referred to as the drÄvidÌ£a-veda (âTamil Vedasâ) or dramidÌ£opanisÌ£ad (âTamil UpanisÌ£adâ). Therefore, this sect, while not limited to Southern India, is much more present in that region than elsewhere. Around the 13th-15th centuries, differences of opinions began to rise with its important ÄcÄryas (e.g. PilÌ£lÌ£ai LokaÌcaÌrya [traditional dates: 1264-1327], VedaÌnta DesÌika [traditional dates: 1268-1369] and ManÌ£avaÌlÌ£a MaÌmuni [traditional dates: 1370-1445]) interpreting the scriptures differently on a few theological issues. This schism became cristallised a couple of centuries later (around the 18th-19th centuries), leading to the formation of two schools, the Northern (vatÌ£akalai) and the Southern (tenÌ±kalai) ones. The former follows in the path shown by VedaÌnta DesÌika.",

The first emperor to receive an official deification was Augustus in 14 CE, although the deification of Julius Caesar, and the establishment of his cult after his assassination in 44 BCE, can be seen as a precursor. Although involving the traditional material and ritual culture of Roman religionsâtemples, altars, sacrifices, festivals, priesthoodsâthe cult was not strictly defined, and substantial variations existed across geographic regions and time periods. The spread of the cult throughout newly acquired territories was an important vehicle for the establishment of Roman imperial authority. For the local elites in provincial cities, the imperial cult offered opportunities to simultaneously express affiliation to Roman values, while promoting individual power agendas. Because the Imperial Cult functioned within the boundaries of traditional Roman religious practice, the answers to many of the questions in this entry broadly apply and make reference to Roman religions as a system.",

However, beginning in the 10th century, some Cham communities began to become influenced by Islam as well. During the seventeenth century, the contemporary form of Cham AhiÃ©r religion became more standardized, as rulers from the Kingdom of Panduranga encouraged practices that blended concepts from the Cham Awal - who practiced a localized form of Islam - and the Cham AhiÃ©r, whose practice is predominantly based on a Brahmanic form of Hinduism. Today, the Cham AhiÃ©r are predominantly Hindu practitioners, although the religion exhibits flares of animistic, shamanistic, and Islamic influence.",

Dusum Khyenpa (dus gsum mkhyen pa) or the 1st Karmapa (1110-1193) founded the lineage in the 12th century in Tibet by nurturing thousands of students and building three major monasteries as his main seats. In the Tibetan spiritual history, he was known as the first reincarnated lama (Tibetan sprul sku: Taking rebirth consciously and on purpose) of Tibet. After receiving profound meditation instructions from Gampopa (1079-1153), his principal teacher, he meditated over sixteen years on the snowy mountains of Kampo Gangra and Tsurphu and conquered his inner channels and breathe, which means he found a survival skill without depending on the outer world. His fame and teachings soon spread all over Tibet, thus, many students, i.e. scholars, Yogis, merchants, and farmers, gathered together around him for seeking his teachings. \n\nTeachings of the lineage mainly focused on a particular method of unifying Mahamudra meditation with Six Yogas of Naropa. Besides that the school practices vast and various sutra and tantra teachings within both monastic and lay audiences. Because of the group identity, monasteries, and the selected teaching transmissions, etc, the lineage was transformed into a systematic school after the Karmapa's death. The lineage has continued for around nine hundred years within the Asian countries. Recently, after 1959, led by the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981), the glory of Karma Kagyu reached an international audience. As a result, in the 21st century, this lineage becomes one of the largest and charismatic Tibetan Buddhist organizations in the world led by two young and talented 17th Karmapas, Ugyen Trinley and Thaye Dorje. Under their leadership, the religious organization has thousands of monasteries, nunneries, monastic institutes, and lay Buddhist Centres around the globe. \n\nLastly, although being an expert in this lineage both academically and empirically, I admit that many answers here are not absolute but variable of time, place, and people. Also, I found that many questions asked here are anthropological and social science-based inquiries, in which the lineage may or may not necessarily have the answers. However, I answered them to complete the data such as the Karma Kagyu population number but keep open to change in the future as one finds scientific proof.",

While Buddhismâs presence in China is dated as early as the 7th century CE (ZÃ¼rcher 2007), the first major wave into Inner Asia arrived during the early TÃ¼rkic rule (552-734 CE) (Christian 1998; Klimkeit 1990). The second wave arrived nearly a thousand years later during the Châing (Manchu) dynasty beginning in 1634 (Barfield 1992; Heissig 1980). Arguably, another wave currently in progress was marked by the demise of the Soviet Union. During their repression of Buddhism in the form of executions and the destruction of lamaseries (MÃ¤nchen-Helfen 1992: 107), the Soviets destroyed Tyvaâs center of Buddhismâthe ÃstÃ¼Ã¼ KhÃ¼ree temple in 1937. However, the temple was recently rebuilt to include residences for students of Buddhism. In 1992, the Dalai Lama visited Tyva and sacralized a locally important mountain (Xaiyrakan) Importantly, there has also been a recent surge in published Buddhist literature in the Tyvan",

Constantine sided against the Donatists. From 317-321, he ordered their suppression using measures akin to those of the persecuting emperors: confiscating property, exile, and death. A brief but violent revival of the persecution occurred in 347-348 under his son, Constans. The emperor Julian (361-363) supported Donatism and brought Donatist bishops back from exile as part of a broader program to undermine Catholic Christianity. \n\nAugustine of Hippo often wrote against them, and the Council of Carthage in 411 also condemned them. Nevertheless, Donatists made up the majority of North African Christians from the fourth to fifth centuries.\n\nThe Donatists fade from view during the Vandal invasions of the mid-fifth century.",

Though such rites are prefigured by techniques found in the Vedas, Epic, and Legal literature--especially those practices labeled sorcery (abhicÄra), root-work (mÅ«lakarman), and medicine craft (auá¹£adhi)--the full bloom of Åaiva magic is found in the tantras.  Magic is not to be confused with the perfections (siddhis) displayed by thaumaturges (siddhas) or the yoga powers displayed by perfected strivers (yogÄ«s); magic is the realm of the, often singular, ritual practitioner (sÄdhaka).",

There existed \"greater\" and \"lesser\" mysteries; initiates of the latter were deemed worthy to witness the former (i.e. they became 'mystai').\n\nThe other great cult ritual at which Demeter stood center, the annual Thesmophoria, involved only women.

Edinoverie allowed the converts from Old Belief to use their previously prohibited rituals and provided them with churches and monasteries where the 'old rites' could be used. This establishment of edinoverie was initiated and supported by the imperial Russian state. Edinovertsy, as the converts to edinoverie were known, were either peasants or merchants: by the time of the Russian Revolution, they numbered no more than 250,000 to 300,000, grouped around approximately 300 parishes scattered across the empire. Controversial within the Church itself and despised by the Old Believers as an instrument of police coercion, edinoverie did not heal the schism in Russian Orthodoxy.",

The word Varkari means pilgrim, so the people going for pilgrimage to Pandharpur came to be known as Varkaris. Reference to the pilgrimage to Pandharpur are found in the Marathi Bhakti literature that flourished 13th century onward.\r\nMedieval Bhakti movement of India had brought certain changes in the Hindu religious practices and also made a substantial  contribution to the vernacular literature. Dnyaneshwara and Namdeva in  the 13-14th  century are considered as a pioneer of this movement in Maharashtra. They were followed by many saints like Chokhamela, Eaknath and Tukaram from 13th to 17th century. The devotional songs composed by them are still sung and played in the houses and at religious congregations of the Hindus of Maharashtra. The movement also provided platform to subalterns.",

    "description": "Bahinabai Chaudhari, popularly remembered as Bahinai, was born in an agrarian village in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra. She had three sisters and three brothers and was married off at the age of 13 to a Vatandar (landowning farmer) - Nathuji Chaudhari. Nathuji was 30 when he married Bahinai; Bahinai was 30 when she was widowed. \n\nBahinai could not read or write. She spent most of her life toiling in farms and kitchens; as a widow, she did the same with the additional burden of clearing her husbandâs financial debt. In this context of everyday labor, Bahinai sang a genre of song called ovi - short, rhyming, rhythmic couplets. She sang in the Khandeshi-Varhadi dialect of Marathi (also called Ahirani). Her songs were preserved and published posthumously by her son, Sopandev, and have since been a topic of academic writing and popular representation in films and school textbooks. \n\nOf the many themes that these songs address, Bahinai's devotion and love (bhakti) for Vitthal (an avatar of Krishna worshipped by Varkaris) is persistent. I, therefore, think that exploring her performance tradition in the disciplinary context of religion could raise important questions - what were the different ways of worshipping Vitthal in Bahinai's immediate context? Why did she sing ovis in the midst of everyday labor like grinding grain and threshing wheat? Are these activities 'religious' or 'folk' or both or neither? Do larger categories like Hinduism elucidate Bahinai's songs at all? And what are the gendered aspects of this genre - in terms of its history and contemporary practice?\n\nThe following questionnaire is a rudimentary attempt to address these questions.",

As part of the South Asian Buddhist revival movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a few Buddhist families from Chittagong settled in Kolkata. They established the Bauddha Dharmankur Sabha (Bengal Buddhist Association) in 1891. More Chittagong Plain Buddhists joined the association during the 1947 India-Pakistan partition as well as at the 1971 Bangladeshâs independence. Currently a significant number of Chittagong Plain Buddhists live in West Bengal as well as in neighbouring states i.e., Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya.",
